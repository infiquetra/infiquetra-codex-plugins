"""Shared 429 retry/backoff primitive — the fleet's one rate-limit response (issue #348).

Lives in fleet-commons (issue #463 / DECISIONS ``{#fleet-commons-mechanism-463}``) so every plugin that
can hit a 429 imports ONE implementation instead of re-writing a bespoke handler. Consumers load it via
their vendored ``fleet_commons_shim``: ``fleet_commons_shim.load("retry_backoff")``.

Two entry points:

* ``retry_with_backoff(fn, *, on_status=429, ...)`` — jittered exponential backoff, attempt cap,
  non-retryable pass-through. A non-429 error propagates immediately; a 429 is retried (honoring a
  ``Retry-After`` hint when supplied) up to ``max_attempts``.
* ``bridge_call(fn, *, breaker, ...)`` — wraps ``retry_with_backoff`` and drives a ``CircuitBreaker``
  (OPEN on a run of rate-limit failures, cooldown, HALF-OPEN probe, CLOSE on success) so a provider
  bridge stops hammering a rate-limited endpoint.

stdlib-only, pure over injected ``sleep``/``rng``/``clock`` seams (deterministic tests). Content changes
here are additive-only within fleet-core 0.x — a consumer never breaks because fleet-core updated.
