# Doc Review

Use this when a plan, requirements document, strategy document, implementation-spec folder, or formal
Infiquetra SDLC artifact is about to guide implementation.

The core question is:

> Can this document safely drive implementation without the agent inventing missing decisions
> or acting on unverified assumptions?

This is not a copy-editing workflow and it is not a replacement for code review.

## Target Resolution

1. If the user supplied a path, read that document.
2. If no path was supplied, look for an obvious active plan or requirements document under
   `docs/plans/` or `docs/brainstorms/`.
3. If the target is still ambiguous, ask for the document path before reviewing.

Do not create a `/ce-doc-review` alias. The Infiquetra command surface is `/doc-review`.

## Classification

Classify by explicit context first, then evidence. Use this precedence:

1. Explicit user command context, such as "review this spec" or "review this issue".
2. Known SDLC paths or identifiers:
   - Blueprint sections or ADRs -> run the idea-phase rubrics inline in this skill.
   - GitHub issue references or issue-derived documents -> run the issue-phase rubrics
     inline in this skill.
   - Specs under `specs/` or documents with spec-phase metadata -> route to `/spec`,
     which runs the spec-phase rubrics.
   - Multi-document implementation spec folders under `platform-specs/06-*` -> use buildability-probe
     mode when the target profile defines exact probe inputs and pass criteria.
3. Content-shape signals:
   - Plan signals: `origin:`, `Implementation Units`, `Key Technical Decisions`, `U1`,
     file lists, test scenarios, verification sections.
   - Requirements signals: goals, non-goals, acceptance examples, flows, success criteria,
     problem framing, `docs/brainstorms/`.
   - Strategy/scope signals: `STRATEGY.md`, strategy updates, founder-scope documents,
     scope or ambition decisions that are about to drive implementation.
4. Path tie-breakers:
   - `docs/plans/` -> plan
   - `docs/brainstorms/` -> requirements
   - `docs/specs/` -> requirements
   - `STRATEGY.md` -> strategy/scope

When classification remains ambiguous, ask before routing. Do not silently guess on a formal
SDLC artifact because routing determines which review responsibilities run.

## Formal SDLC Rubric Review

Formal SDLC artifacts get the Infiquetra rubric review first, run inline via the rubric engine
at `../../scripts/lifecycle_review.py` (relative to this skill) against the rubrics under
`saga/references/rubrics/{idea,spec,issue}/{core,extras}/`. Map artifact to phase:

- Blueprint sections and ADRs -> `idea` phase.
- GitHub issues and issue-derived documents -> `issue` phase.
- Specifications -> `spec` phase, owned by `/spec`; route there rather than running it here.

For the resolved phase, run the engine like so:

1. List the always-apply core rubrics and the conditional extras:
   - `python3 ../../scripts/lifecycle_review.py rubrics list-cores --phase <idea|issue>`
   - `python3 ../../scripts/lifecycle_review.py rubrics list-extras --phase <idea|issue>`
2. Apply every `core` rubric for the phase. Apply each `extras` rubric only when its
   applicability condition fits the artifact, by judgment.
3. Read each selected rubric's content and apply it to the document:
   - `python3 ../../scripts/lifecycle_review.py rubrics read --phase <idea|issue> --slug <slug>`

After the rubric review finishes, run the readiness-skeptic pass. Re-read the target document,
collect any appended review log when present, and include unresolved rubric findings in the
readiness summary. Do not reclassify rubric findings as readiness findings.

If the rubric engine or its rubrics are unavailable, say so clearly and continue with the
readiness review where safe.

## Buildability-Probe Mode

Use buildability-probe mode for a profile-backed, multi-document implementation spec set that is about
to drive a build. Normal readiness review is still the right gate for single docs, plans, requirements,
issues, and strategy.

The probe is a fresh-context cold-builder simulation. Do not run it inline in the same context that
authored or remediated the spec. Prefer `team-execution` delegated mode when it can provide a clean
review context; otherwise tell the operator that a new session is required for the probe to be valid.

Probe inputs are profile-owned. For the service-implementation profile, pass only:

- the service folder set;
- `platform-specs/05-technical-specifications/`;
- accepted ADRs from the target library's ADR index;
- PRD-0001 when present;
- the target library's acceptance matrix when present.

Do not add authoring notes, prior probe artifacts, remediation notes, or unrelated repo memory to the
probe input set.

The probe artifact must include:

1. implementation breakdown: repos, stacks, endpoints, tables, events, and test plan;
2. exhaustive assumptions and questions by category: product, architecture, data, API, operations;
3. per-question boundary-test classification;
4. `VERDICT: PASS` only when there are zero spec defects.

Boundary test: if two reasonable implementers could answer a question differently and the difference is
visible in API behavior, data shape, or user experience, it is a spec defect. Otherwise it is an
execution-time discovery.

Write probe artifacts under `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-buildability-probe[-rN].md`. A failed
probe maps boundary-test defects to P0/P1 findings and blocks `/plan` or `/work` unless the operator
explicitly overrides with a rationale. Remediation closes the defect class across the folder set; it
does not patch only the cited line. After remediation, run a fresh probe. Escalate after three failed
rounds.

## Readiness-Skeptic Pass

Always check:

1. **Verification.** Claims, requirements, and actions must be supported by cited evidence,
   the document itself, linked source, or local repository evidence.
2. **Assumptions.** Surface stale, wrong, or unstated assumptions that would affect execution.
3. **Requirement mapping.** Check origin requirements, acceptance criteria, schema requirements,
   implementation units, and gates map correctly.
4. **Completeness.** Detect missing fields, schema requirements, gates, decisions, or review
   artifacts the document already implies.
5. **Open-choice pressure.** Flag implementation choices that should be defaults, decisions, or
   explicit evidence-gathering tasks.
6. **Adversarial failure modes.** Ask what breaks if an agent follows the document literally.

Triggered lenses:

- Use security/ops scrutiny when the document touches secrets, authorization, deployment,
  infrastructure, data, or external integrations.
- Suggest `/founder-review` as an additional lens when strategy, product scope, ambition, or
  user-facing behavior is prominent.
- Use deployment readiness scrutiny when the document includes deploy, rollback, release,
  environment, or CI/CD behavior.

## Safe In-Place Fixes

Safe fixes are enabled by default and edit the reviewed document in place.

Safe means the document itself, linked source, or local repository evidence clearly supports the
change. Examples:

- add missing schema fields already implied elsewhere in the document
- correct origin requirement mappings when the right mapping is evident
- move follow-up work out of canonical schema and into prose or runbook sections
- fill in gates or checklist items already required by the surrounding section
- fix stale internal references, broken headings, wrong counts, or inconsistent naming

Unsafe changes become findings instead of edits:

- inventing acceptance criteria
- choosing architecture without evidence
- changing scope based on preference
- resolving product decisions without user input
- adding requirements not implied by source material

## Findings

Report remaining findings using priorities:

- `P0`: The document would cause unsafe, incorrect, destructive, or materially wrong execution.
- `P1`: The document is not ready to drive implementation because a core assumption, mapping,
  requirement, default, or gate is missing or wrong.
- `P2`: The document can probably drive work, but the issue creates meaningful rework,
  ambiguity, or review risk.
- `P3`: Nice-to-fix clarity, maintainability, or polish issue.

Lead with findings. A short readiness summary is useful, but P-level findings are the primary
output language.

## Durable Review Artifacts

Write a review artifact under `docs/reviews/` when any trigger is true:

- any `P0` or `P1` finding remains
- any safe fix edits the document
- a formal SDLC rubric review ran
- an issue-attached lifecycle flow is active
- more than three findings remain after safe fixes

Every significant review artifact should include:

- This review-result contract:
- target path
- reviewed revision when available, such as a commit SHA or explicit "working tree"
- blocked status
- finding priorities and statuses
- applied fixes
- review artifact path
- override rationale when applicable
- linked issue, plan, or work-session path when available

Ignored local state under `.codex/saga/` is not durable review output.

## Loop And Work Integration

`/doc-review` is explicit by default. `/work` should ask whether to run it before executing from
a plan or requirements document.

If `/doc-review` runs and unresolved `P0` or `P1` findings remain, `/work` blocks unless the
user explicitly overrides. `/work` may consume same-session review output or the latest matching
`docs/reviews/` artifact. Overrides need a rationale that can be carried into issue progress or
work-session notes.

For issue-attached work, summarize:

- fixes applied
- remaining findings
- blocked status
- override rationale, when present
- review artifact link

## Output Shape

The generated readiness report and the `docs/reviews/` artifact follow the shared formatting contract
in `saga/references/formatting-style.md`: lead the readiness
summary and each section with a one-line plain-language verdict, render the by-priority findings as a
table (one row per finding, with its `P0`-`P3` priority and status), and keep narrative fields as short
(≤3-sentence) blank-line-separated prose.

Use this structure:

1. Applied fixes, if any.
2. Readiness summary.
3. Remaining findings by priority.
4. Review artifact path, when written.
5. Residual risk from limited evidence, if any.

If no issues are found, say so clearly and name any remaining risk from limited evidence.
