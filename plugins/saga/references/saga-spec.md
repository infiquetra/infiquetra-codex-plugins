# Saga Specification (saga)

**Status:** canonical contract · **schema_version:** `1.0` · **plugin version:** 0.4.0
**Engine:** [`scripts/saga.py`](../scripts/saga.py)
**Audience:** the four execution-loop commands (`/plan`, `/work`, `/resume`, `/loop`) implement against this
file when they are rebuilt. They MUST treat the field names, enum values, and operation semantics below as
the single source of truth. If code and this document disagree, that is a bug in one of them — fix it, do
not work around it.

> The engine shipped as a primitive in 0.4.0 (unit tests + manual smoke) and is now **consumed**: `/plan`
> (0.7.0) writes a plan saga via `save`, `/code-review` (0.8.0) is the first review-track consumer
> (append-only/never-mint to an existing thread's `review_paths`), and `/work` (0.10.0) is the **primary
> writer** — it `scan`s/`restore`s on re-entry and writes a tick per phase. `/resume` + `/loop` wiring
> remains queued. This spec is the single source of truth those consumers implement against.

## 1. What a saga is

A **saga** is the durable, resumable work-state envelope for **one thread of lifecycle work** — exactly one
GitHub issue (`kind=issue`) or one ad-hoc task (`kind=task`). It is the spine that carries a single thread
from idea through plan, work, review, QA, and retro across many sessions, machines, and rounds. A saga
answers, from cold, three questions a resumer needs:

1. **Where are we?** — `lifecycle_phase`, `phase`, `phase_status`, `round`.
2. **What is the disposition?** — `status` (active / blocked / paused / handed-off / done / abandoned).
3. **What is the single next move?** — `next_step` (the imperative resume anchor) + `## Remaining`.

A saga is a **log of immutable ticks**. Each save appends a new timestamped envelope file; the
newest-by-filename tick is the current state. Earlier ticks are immutable history. A derived
`state.json` index summarizes all sagas for fast lookup, but it is rebuildable and never authoritative.

### 1.1 Ownership boundary (a saga links, it does not own, another owner's state)

A saga owns **only its own work-thread state**. Everything else it references by pointer. This is a hard
directive boundary:

| Owner | Owns | Saga holds |
|---|---|---|
| **mission-control** | the GitHub issue, its body, labels, project-board fields, comments | `issue_ref` pointer (`owner/repo#N`), cached scalars for offline display only |
| **deploy** | deployment mutation, tag promotion, environment state | `destination` intent + `pr_refs`; never a deploy authority |
| **engineering-journal** (`docs/engineering-journal/`) | the durable DECISIONS / LEARNINGS record | `journal_refs`, `adr_refs` pointers; `## Decisions` mirrors KTDs but the journal is canonical |
| **git** | branch, commit, working tree | `branch`, `head_sha`, `last_commit_sha` cached for offline display only |

A saga is **valid offline** (it reads no network to `restore`) but is **never the authority** for another
owner's state. When a saga's cached scalar (e.g. a stale `branch`) disagrees with the owner, the owner wins.

---

## 2. Identity

A saga's id is **derived** from `kind` + `id`, minted at birth, and **sticky** for the saga's whole life:

```
derive_saga_id("issue", "42")               -> "issue-42"
derive_saga_id("task", "Saga Foundation!")  -> "task-saga-foundation"
```

- `issue-<N>` — `<N>` is the issue number verbatim.
- `task-<slug>` — `<slug>` is `slugify(id)`: lowercase, alphanumeric runs hyphen-joined, empty -> `"saga"`.

**`round` and `phase` are FIELDS, never part of identity.** A saga keeps one directory
(`sagas/<saga_id>/`) across all rounds and phases; round/phase live in the frontmatter. This is the whole
point of the unify: one stable home per thread, many ticks inside it.

### 2.1 Adopted-issue cross-reference (`issue_ref` -> `saga_id`)

A task-born saga that later gets a GitHub issue **keeps its `task-<slug>` id** (the id is sticky) and gains
an `issue_ref` (`owner/repo#N`). Its directory name still says `task-…`, which would make it invisible to a
"find by issue number" lookup. The derived index closes that gap: a reader resolves an issue number to a
`saga_id` by scanning `state.json.sagas[*].issue_ref`, not by guessing the directory name.

> **Consumer rule:** to find the saga for issue N, first try `derive_saga_id("issue", N)`; if that has no
> directory, scan `state.json.sagas` for a `saga_id` whose `issue_ref` ends in `#N`. Do **not** rename the
> directory to match the issue — the id is sticky.

### 2.2 Collision guard (task-slug)

Two different tasks can slugify to the same `task-<slug>` (e.g. "Saga Foundation" and "saga-foundation!").
Before minting a brand-new saga at a `task-<slug>` directory that already exists, a consumer **MUST** check
the existing latest tick:

- **Same thread** (matching `issue_ref` / `created_at`, or the user confirms "resume this") -> reuse it
  (append a tick). This is the common, correct case.
- **Divergent thread** (different `issue_ref` / `created_at` and the user did not confirm resume) -> refuse
  or warn; the consumer should disambiguate the slug (e.g. append a discriminator to `id` before deriving)
  rather than silently fork an unrelated thread onto the same id.

### 2.3 Slug-instability mitigation

A task description that drifts ("Saga foundation" -> "Saga foundation engine") slugs to a different id and
would mint a second saga for the same work. Mitigation is a **consumer convention**, not engine magic:
`/plan` (and any creation path) **SHOULD `scan` first and offer "resume existing saga?"** before minting a
new one. The engine cannot detect intent; the consumer must.

---

## 3. File format

Each tick is a gstack-style envelope: **YAML frontmatter (machine fields) + a Markdown body (prose
sections)**, stored at `sagas/<saga_id>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md`. `render_envelope` / `parse_envelope` are
exact inverses and preserve unknown keys (§3.5).

### 3.1 Frontmatter field table

Rendered in this exact order (`FRONTMATTER_FIELDS`), then sorted `extra` keys. `req` = required to
construct a `Saga` (no default); all others have the listed default.

| Field | Type | Req | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | str | — | `"1.0"` | Envelope schema version (§9). |
| `saga_id` | str | ✅ | — | Sticky derived id (§2). |
| `kind` | str | ✅ | — | `issue` or `task`. |
| `id` | str | ✅ | — | Issue number (as str) or task slug source. |
| `created_at` | str (ISO) | — | `""` | First tick's timestamp; sticky across ticks. |
| `updated_at` | str (ISO) | — | `""` | This tick's timestamp (= save moment). |
| `lifecycle_phase` | enum | — | `ideation` | CE-flow position (§4) — **MUST** be in `LIFECYCLE_PHASES`. |
| `phase_status` | enum | — | `pending` | Phase completion (§4) — **MUST** be in `PHASE_STATUSES`. |
| `status` | enum | — | `active` | Thread disposition (§4) — **MUST** be in `STATUSES`, **MUST NOT** be `pending`/`in_progress`. |
| `next_step` | str | — | `""` | The one imperative resume anchor (top of `## Remaining`). |
| `orchestration_mode` | enum | — | `inline` | How work runs — decision contract in `references/operator-choice.md`; **MUST** be in `ORCHESTRATION_MODES`. |
| `orchestration_ref` | str | — | `""` | Empty for `inline` / `manual`; for executable `team-execution`, points to a `## Team Structure` receipt or protected evidence root. |
| `issue_ref` | str | — | `""` | `owner/repo#N` pointer; empty for plan-only / pre-issue work. |
| `destination` | enum | — | `plan-only` | Routing intent — **MUST** be in `DESTINATIONS`. Mirrors `lifecycle_state`. |
| `round` | int | — | `0` | Current PR/iteration round. |
| `phase` | int | — | `0` | Current numeric phase within the work plan. |
| `progress_pct` | int | — | `0` | Coarse progress (display only). |
| `plan_path` | str | — | `""` | Pointer to the durable plan doc. |
| `work_session_paths` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Pointers to `docs/work-sessions/` writeups. |
| `review_paths` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Pointers to review docs. |
| `qa_paths` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Pointers to QA docs. |
| `branch` | str | — | `""` | Cached git branch (offline display; git is authority). |
| `head_sha` | str | — | `""` | Cached short HEAD (offline display). |
| `last_commit_sha` | str | — | `""` | Cached full HEAD (offline display). |
| `files_modified` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Files touched this thread (display). |
| `rounds_seen` | list[int] | — | snapshot | Every round number observed; drives `next_round` (§6). |
| `next_round` | int | — | `1` | Derived: `max(rounds_seen)+1` else `1`. Set by `save`, not by caller. |
| `pr_refs` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Pointers to PRs. |
| `adr_refs` | list[str] | — | snapshot | `ADR-NNNN` pointers into the journal. |
| `journal_refs` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Pointers to journal entries. |
| `blockers` | str | — | `""` | Free-text blockers. |
| `open_questions` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Outstanding questions (snapshot — see §6). |
| `checks_run` | list[str] | — | snapshot | Tests / gates run (snapshot). |
| `source` | str | — | `""` | Origin artifact path (e.g. `docs/plans/…`). |

"snapshot" = list field with full-snapshot semantics (§6); defaults to the `ABSENT` sentinel in memory but
is always a concrete list once persisted/parsed.

**Body sections** (after the closing `---`), all free-form prose, all preserved on round-trip:

| Heading | Saga field | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `## Summary` | `summary` | One-paragraph state of the thread. |
| `## Decisions` | `decisions` | KTDs (key technical decisions) — mirrored to the journal, which is canonical. |
| `## Remaining` | `remaining` | Outstanding work; **the top item equals `next_step`**. |
| `## Notes / Tried` | `notes` | Scratchpad / tried-and-rejected notes. The parser also accepts `## Notes`. |

### 3.2 The three stored axes + one derived (MUST rules)

There are **three independent stored axes** and **one derived** value. Keeping them separate removes the
historical `status`↔`phase_status` ambiguity.

- **`lifecycle_phase`** — *where in the CE flow are we.* One of
  `ideation | brainstorm | plan | review | work | qa | retro`. This is a **superset** of
  `handoff_envelope.infer_lifecycle_phase` (which emits only
  `ideation | brainstorm | plan | review | work | unknown`); saga **extends** it (adds `qa`, `retro`; never
  emits `unknown`). It is the flow-position field — "have we ideated and brainstormed yet."
  **MUST** be a member of `LIFECYCLE_PHASES`.
- **`phase_status`** — *is the current numeric `phase` finished.* One of `pending | in_progress | complete`.
  **Authoritative** for "is the phase done." Drives `next_phase` (§5). **MUST** be a member of
  `PHASE_STATUSES`.
- **`status`** — *thread disposition.* One of `active | blocked | paused | handed-off | done | abandoned`.
  **MUST** be a member of `STATUSES`. **MUST NOT** ever take `pending` or `in_progress` — those values
  belong exclusively to `phase_status`. A saga can be `phase_status=complete` while `status=active` (phase
  done, thread still going) or `status=done` (thread finished).
- **`maturity`** — **DERIVED, NEVER STORED.** Computed at `/handoff` time from `lifecycle_phase` via
  `PHASE_TO_MATURITY`. No `maturity` key ever appears in frontmatter; any consumer that needs it derives it.

### 3.3 `lifecycle_phase` -> `maturity` derivation (handoff only)

| `lifecycle_phase` | derived `maturity` |
|---|---|
| `ideation` | `idea-ready` |
| `brainstorm` | `requirements-ready` |
| `plan` | `plan-ready` |
| `review` | `plan-ready` |
| `work` | `resume-ready` |
| `qa` | `resume-ready` |
| `retro` | `resume-ready` |

Fallback for any unmapped value: `requirements-ready` (matches `handoff_envelope.infer_maturity`'s default).

**Off-chain doc-path note (`/spec`).** A `docs/specs/` artifact (off-chain `/spec`) is not on the saga
chain: `handoff_envelope.infer_lifecycle_phase` returns `"unknown"` for it (no `spec` member is added to
`LIFECYCLE_PHASES`), and `infer_maturity` maps `docs/specs/` → `requirements-ready` directly (a sharp
WHAT — equals the unmapped fallback, set explicitly for consistency). A spec hands off as
`requirements-ready` with `lifecycle_phase: unknown`.

## Summary

Saga engine built; wrappers + spec done. Mid-wiring of consumers.

## Decisions

Derived sticky id; append-only log + derived index; filename-as-order (never mtime).

## Remaining

wire /resume to call saga.restore
then /work, /loop, /plan

## Notes / Tried

Considered minted UUID ids — rejected (not human-legible, no offline issue lookup).
```

### 3.5 Unknown-key preservation (`extra`)

`parse_envelope` routes any frontmatter key it does not recognize into `Saga.extra`; `render_envelope`
re-emits `extra` keys (sorted) after the known fields. A newer writer's field therefore survives a
read-modify-write by an older reader — forward-compatible round-trip. Consumers **MUST NOT** strip `extra`.

---

## 4. Enum domains (authoritative)

```python
LIFECYCLE_PHASES   = ("ideation", "brainstorm", "plan", "review", "work", "qa", "retro")
PHASE_STATUSES     = ("pending", "in_progress", "complete")
STATUSES           = ("active", "blocked", "paused", "handed-off", "done", "abandoned")
DESTINATIONS       = ("plan-only", "pr", "merge", "nonprod-deploy")
ORCHESTRATION_MODES = ("inline", "manual", "team-execution")
```

`destination` mirrors `lifecycle_state.normalize_destination`'s canonical set — use that helper to normalize
user-facing labels (`deploy` -> `nonprod-deploy`, etc.) before storing.

---

## 5. Storage

### 5.1 Three storage tiers

```
.codex/saga/          # git-ignored (.gitignore) — volatile local state
├── sagas/                             # CANONICAL — append-only immutable envelope log
│   ├── issue-42/
│   │   ├── 20260602-140510.md         # tick 1
│   │   └── 20260602-141233.md         # tick 2 — newest FILENAME = current state
│   └── task-saga-foundation/
│       └── 20260602-093000.md
├── state.json                         # DERIVED index (rebuildable from a scan; never authoritative)
└── checkpoints/                       # LEGACY (pre-0.4.0) — scan reads as low-priority fallback, 1 version
```

- **`sagas/` is canonical.** Each tick is immutable; `save` never overwrites a tick, it appends a new one.
- **`state.json` is derived** (§5.4). If it is missing or corrupt, that is **non-fatal**: `scan` rebuilds
  the picture from `sagas/`, and the next `save` rewrites a valid index.
- **`checkpoints/` is legacy.** Pre-0.4.0 per-phase checkpoint files (`{kind}-{id}[-round-N]-phaseM[-status].md`).
  `scan` reads them as **flagged, low-priority fallback for one version** (§8), then they are dropped.

### 5.2 Filename IS the order — never `mtime`

Ticks are ordered **purely by filename string**, never by file modification time. The newest tick for a saga
is `max(files, key=envelope_sort_key)`; `restore` reads exactly that file.

> **Why filename, not mtime:** so that **rsync / backup / snapshot-restore** preserve tick order
> deterministically. A copy tool can rewrite every file's mtime (e.g. all-equal on restore, or reordered),
> which would silently corrupt an mtime-ordered scan. Filename order survives any byte-faithful copy.
>
> **This is NOT about git worktrees.** Git worktrees do not copy git-ignored files at all, so saga state
> created in a worktree lives only in that worktree's ignored `.codex/` and is discarded on cleanup — that
> is expected, volatile dev state. The filename-order win is the rsync/backup case, not the worktree case.

### 5.3 Scan ordering + collision

- Filename pattern: `^(?P<ts>\d{8}-\d{6})(?:-(?P<seq>\d+))?\.md$` (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` + optional `-N`).
- **Same-second collision** -> the writer appends `-1`, `-2`, … . The sort key is
  `envelope_sort_key(name) = (ts, seq)` where the base tick `<ts>.md` is `seq=0` and `<ts>-N.md` is `seq=N`.
  This guarantees the suffixed file sorts **after** its base (a naive string compare would wrongly place
  `<ts>-1.md` before `<ts>.md` because `-` < `.`). Ordering is still derived entirely from the filename.
- `scan` returns **one candidate per saga** (the latest tick of each), `sagas/` candidates **newest-first**
  by `envelope_sort_key`, then legacy checkpoints appended after (so live sagas always rank above legacy).
- Non-matching files and non-directory entries are skipped silently.

### 5.4 `state.json` shape (derived index)

```json
{
  "last_updated": "<iso>",
  "active_saga_id": "<saga_id>",
  "sagas": {
    "<saga_id>": {
      "saga_id", "kind", "id", "lifecycle_phase", "phase_status", "status",
      "phase", "round", "next_phase", "next_round", "destination",
      "issue_ref", "plan_path", "next_step", "updated_at"
    }
  },
  "current_work": {
    "kind", "id", "round", "phase", "phase_status", "destination",
    "plan_path", "work_session_path", "next_steps": ["<next_step>"], "saga_id"
  }
}
```

- `sagas` is a per-saga summary map (one entry per known saga).
- `current_work` mirrors the **most-recently-saved** saga, **carries its `saga_id`**, and keeps the legacy
  key set (`plan_path`, `work_session_path`, `next_steps`) **UNCHANGED** — `handoff_envelope.py` and its
  test read `current_work.plan_path` / `current_work.work_session_path`, so those keys MUST stay stable.
  `work_session_path` = the first entry of `work_session_paths` (or `""`).

---

## 6. List merge semantics — full snapshot, never union

A tick is a **full snapshot**, so list fields use snapshot-replace semantics at `save` time. There are
three distinguishable input states (the `ABSENT` sentinel distinguishes "carry forward" from "clear"):

| Incoming list value | Result in the new tick |
|---|---|
| **Populated** `[a, b]` | **REPLACE** — the new tick's list is exactly `[a, b]` (prior list discarded). |
| **Empty** `[]` | **CLEAR** — the new tick's list is `[]`. |
| **`ABSENT`** (omitted) | **CARRY FORWARD** — copy the prior tick's list verbatim (or `[]` for a new saga). |

**Never union.** Union-only lists accumulate stale `open_questions` and `files_modified` that mislead a cold
resume; snapshot semantics let a resume payload **shrink** (e.g. an `open_question` that got answered drops
off the next tick). A persisted/parsed tick always holds **concrete** lists (never `ABSENT`).

**Scalar carry-forward:** a scalar field left at its dataclass default in the incoming saga inherits the
prior tick's value. To *clear* a scalar you must pass a non-default sentinel value explicitly (e.g. `" "`),
since the default and "unset" are indistinguishable for scalars. `created_at` is sticky from the first tick;
`updated_at` is always the save moment; `next_round` is recomputed (§6.1).

### 6.1 Derived-at-save fields

- `next_round = max(rounds_seen) + 1` (or `1` if `rounds_seen` is empty). The caller MUST NOT set it.
- `next_phase = phase + 1 if phase_status == "complete" else phase`. Returned by `save`, surfaced in
  `scan` candidates and `state.json` summaries.
- `branch` / `head_sha` / `last_commit_sha` — if left empty, `save` fills them from a **guarded** git probe
  (`current_git_state`); any git failure yields empty strings (never raises). `restore` never probes git.

---

## 7. Operation contract (`save` / `restore` / `scan`)

| Op | Reads | Writes | Subprocess? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `save(root, saga, *, now=, runner=)` | latest prior tick (`restore`) | new immutable tick + `state.json` | yes (guarded git) | merges (§6); returns `{saga_id, envelope_path, state_path, phase, status, next_phase, next_round}`. |
| `restore(root, saga_id)` | latest tick by filename | — | **no** | cold, branch-agnostic; `None` if no tick. NEVER calls git/subprocess. |
| `scan(root, *, max_candidates=)` | latest tick per saga + legacy | — | no | one candidate/saga, newest-first, legacy appended + flagged. |
| `update_index(root, saga, *, now=)` | existing `state.json` | `state.json` | no | atomic temp+rename; corrupt prior index rebuilt. |
| `latest_envelope_for(root, saga_id)` | tick filenames | — | no | the newest tick `Path` by `envelope_sort_key`, or `None`. |
| `aggregate_context(root, owner, repo, issue, *, runner=)` | saga + `gh` PRs + journal | — | yes (guarded `gh`) | missing `gh` no-raises -> empty PR list. |

### 7.1 Atomicity + best-effort index

`update_index` writes via **temp file + `os.replace`** (atomic on POSIX), so a reader never sees a
half-written `state.json`. The index is nonetheless **best-effort / racy** under concurrent writers: two
sessions saving different sagas can clobber each other's `current_work` (last writer wins). That is
acceptable because:

- `current_work` is rebuildable (re-save the saga, or read it from `sagas/` directly), and
- `scan` (reading `sagas/`) — not `state.json` — is the **source of truth** for "what work exists."

A reader that needs the authoritative current state of saga X MUST `restore(root, X)` (read the canonical
log), not trust `state.json.current_work`.

### 7.2 Cold-resume / branch-agnostic

`restore` reads only the envelope (frontmatter + body). It does **not** consult git, the network, or the
current checkout, so a saga restores **identically on any branch or machine** that has the `sagas/`
directory. (The cached `branch`/`head_sha` may be stale — that is fine, git is the authority for those.)

---

## 8. Migration (pre-0.4.0 -> 0.4.0)

- **Format change:** checkpoints moved from flat `checkpoints/{kind}-{id}[-round-N]-phaseM[-status].md`
  (overwrite-in-place, mtime-ordered) to `sagas/<saga_id>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md` (append-only,
  filename-ordered).
- **No automatic data migration.** Old `checkpoints/` files are **read by `scan` as flagged, low-priority
  fallback for one version** (each carries `legacy: true` and a reduced key set), then support is dropped.
- **Upgrade warning:** complete any in-flight loop on the legacy format **before** upgrading. A loop that
  spans the upgrade should re-save through `saga.save` to materialize a `sagas/` entry; otherwise its state
  lives only in `checkpoints/` and survives just one more version of `scan`.

---

## 9. Versioning

- **`schema_version`** (currently `"1.0"`) is a frontmatter field stamped on every tick. Bump it on any
  breaking change to field meaning or layout. Readers SHOULD tolerate a higher `schema_version` they do not
  fully understand by relying on `extra` round-trip (§3.5) rather than dropping unknown keys.
- **Additive evolution** (new optional frontmatter field) does **not** require a `schema_version` bump: the
  `extra` mechanism preserves it across older readers, and adding a field with a default keeps old envelopes
  parseable.
- The plugin's own SemVer (`plugin.json` / `marketplace.json`) tracks the capability; `schema_version`
  tracks the on-disk envelope contract. They move independently.

---

## 10. Link-vs-duplicate policy

| Concept | Authority (owner) | Saga stores | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Issue body / labels / board | mission-control | `issue_ref` pointer | mission-control owns issue artifacts. |
| Plan document | the plan doc | `plan_path` pointer | doc is canonical; saga points. |
| Work-session / review / QA writeups | the docs | `work_session_paths` / `review_paths` / `qa_paths` | docs are canonical. |
| PRs | GitHub | `pr_refs` pointers | GitHub is canonical. |
| Decisions / ADRs / learnings | engineering-journal | `journal_refs` / `adr_refs` + `## Decisions` mirror | journal is canonical; `## Decisions` is a convenience mirror only. |
| Branch / commit | git | `branch` / `head_sha` / `last_commit_sha` cache | git is canonical; cache is for offline display. |
| Deployment | deploy | `destination` intent + `pr_refs` | deploy owns mutation. |

**Rule:** cache tiny scalars for offline display, but **never** treat a cached value as authoritative when
the owner is reachable. When in doubt, store a pointer, not a copy.

---

## 11. Consumer contract (rebuild targets)

Each command below implements against this spec when rebuilt. None call the engine after the 0.4.0 PR —
this table is the wiring contract for their own queued items.

| Command | Reads | Writes (`save`) |
|---|---|---|
| **/plan** | `scan` (offer "resume existing?" before minting — §2.3) | `lifecycle_phase=plan`, `plan_path`, `destination`, `adr_refs`; `## Decisions` = KTDs. |
| **/work** | `restore` (rehydrate `round`/`phase`/`checks_run`/`next_step`) | primary writer: per-phase ticks, round bump (`rounds_seen`), `checks_run`, `work_session_paths`, `issue_ref` adoption, `status=done` at completion. |
| **/code-review** | the diff + `scan`/`restore` (the existing work-thread) | review-track consumer: appends `review_paths` (append-only, never mints); **never advances `lifecycle_phase`** (preserves it). |
| **/qa** | `restore` (the work-thread) | qa-track consumer: writes `qa_paths`; on PASS advances `lifecycle_phase` `work`→`qa`; on FAIL keeps `lifecycle_phase=work`. Never mints. |
| **/resume** | `restore` (cold reconstruction) + `scan` (candidate list) | routes to `/work` or `/handoff`; may save a `status=paused`/`active` re-entry tick. |
| **/loop** | `scan` at start (offer resume) | creation tick + a tick per routing decision; `status=handed-off` when routing to `/handoff`. |

`/handoff` derives `maturity` from `lifecycle_phase` (§3.3) at handoff time; it does not read a stored
`maturity` because there isn't one.

## 12. Edge cases (MUST / SHOULD)

- **MUST** keep `status` out of the `phase_status` domain (no `pending`/`in_progress` in `status`) and vice
  versa.
- **MUST** treat a missing/corrupt `state.json` as non-fatal: `scan` rebuilds from `sagas/`.
- **MUST** order ticks by filename (`envelope_sort_key`), never by `mtime` (§5.2).
- **MUST** preserve unknown frontmatter keys via `extra` (§3.5) — never strip them on round-trip.
- **MUST NOT** let `restore` shell out to git or the network (cold, branch-agnostic — §7.2).
- **MUST** treat a missing `gh` as empty PR data in `aggregate_context`/`prior_prs`, never an exception (§7).
- **SHOULD** `scan` and offer "resume existing?" before minting a new task saga (slug-instability — §2.3).
- **SHOULD** guard task-slug collisions against an existing divergent saga before appending (§2.2).
- **SHOULD** resolve issue->saga via `state.json.sagas[*].issue_ref` when the `issue-<N>` directory is
  absent (adopted-issue case — §2.1).

### 12.1 Append-only growth (deferred)

Ticks accumulate; there is **no GC today**. A future `max_ticks` retention policy is the planned seam — it
prunes oldest ticks while keeping the newest authoritative, so it is purely additive and needs **no schema
change**. Until then, growth is bounded only by save frequency and is acceptable for the volatile,
machine-local `.codex/` location.
