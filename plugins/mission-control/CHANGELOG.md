# Changelog — mission-control

## 2.4.0 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added idempotent `flow assign-mimir --repo REPO --number N`, adapted from canonical Claude
  Mission Control 2.10.0 at `9adb971020df9eb5928595760b5e9c75e498ef2c`. Before its only
  mutation it reads Team Mimir's exact live coverage from authenticated GitHub, requires an
  active issue route, an open issue, triage-or-higher operator authority, and the repository's
  existing `intake:mimir` label. Success is emitted only after issue readback and includes trigger
  state, coverage route, issue URL, and live Objective project-field values when present.
- Added fail-closed coverage for unsupported repositories, closed issues, insufficient authority,
  missing or malformed policy, missing trigger labels, API failures, and failed mutation readback.
  The command creates no labels, comments, repository admissions, or alternate credential paths.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Retired Objective as a creatable issue type. Objectives are project-field options plus Outcome
  Scorecard docs; Capabilities are top-level by default.
- Changed the interactive parent prompt to default to no parent and reserve native sub-issues for
  real decomposition.

### Added
- Added idempotent `flow unlink-sub-issue` for removing accidental or retired parent layers
  without closing either issue.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Added `executor_profile_lint.py`: a standalone CLI that validates a program issue's
  "Recommended Executor Profile" block (model/effort membership, above-sonnet-requires-
  justification) against the fleet-core tier palette, resolved through the vendored
  `fleet_commons_shim`.

### Fixed
- Fixed `issue create-prepared` post-create recovery: if the GitHub issue was created but a
  later board-add or Status-set step failed, the sidecar is now left in a resumable
  `post_create_pending` state (remaining steps + created issue reference) instead of losing
  track of the created issue, so a re-run resumes rather than creating a duplicate issue.
- Fixed the GitHub contents API template-deploy path to always use `PUT` (the only verb that
  endpoint accepts for both create and update); it previously issued `POST`/`PATCH`, which are
  invalid for `contents/{path}` and would fail against the live API.
- Fixed the `issueOrPullRequest` GraphQL lookups (item node id, item labels) to use the
  `issueOrPullRequest(number:)` union field instead of separate `issue`/`pullRequest` fields,
  and to null-safe the `repository` node so a deleted/inaccessible repo does not crash the
  lookup.

### Changed
- Renamed the `jeff-intent` project board to `operations` across config, scripts, and skill
  guidance (GitHub Project #3 was renamed Jeff Intent -> Operations on 2026-06-27; the project
  number, node id, and shared `intent_flow` workflow are unchanged, so existing cards stay on
  the board). `--project jeff-intent` is no longer accepted; use `--project operations`.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Added the vendored SDLC issue-contract generated artifacts and parity checker used by
  prepared issue validation.
- Added prepared issue approval gating: `issue approve` must mark a ready draft before
  `issue create-prepared` mutates, unless the operator explicitly passes `--skip-approval`.

### Changed
- Retired Mount Olympus from active routing and moved active board guidance to Jeff Intent,
  Asgard, and CAMPPS Project #4.
- Updated board, flow, metrics, issue, rollout, and milestone guidance for the CAMPPS
  `Idea -> Committed -> In Progress -> Done -> Parked` workflow.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- Tracked the `infiquetra-loop` → `saga` rename: updated the ignored runtime-state
  path to `.codex/saga/` and refreshed plugin references in `/issue`, the
  `sdlc-operator` agent, and the `issues` skill.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Added `/issue` as the primary issue command surface, with `/issue` retained as a
  compatibility alias.
- Added prepared-issue handoff maturity metadata and source artifact resolution for local files,
  GitHub issue/PR URLs, branch refs, and natural hints such as "from the brainstorm".

### Changed
- Synced the vendored SDLC schema and Asgard prepared-issue readiness with the corrected
  Asgard/Olympus model: sibling target boards with explicit cross-team transfer, not an
  implied Asgard-to-Olympus promotion path.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- Added `issue prepare` to write team-aware Asgard or Mount Olympus issue drafts under
  `docs/sdlc-issue-drafts/` with JSON readiness sidecars.
- Added `issue create-prepared` to re-run readiness, render a full mutation plan, ask for final
  confirmation, repair missing labels/templates, add issues to the requested project, set safe
  starting status, and record the created issue back onto the draft.
- Added Asgard and Olympus readiness profiles. Asgard accepts shaping-quality drafts with mode,
  constraints, risk, and transfer notes; Olympus requires the strict actionable card body,
  expected labels, project presence, author-visible risk, and safe `Backlog` status.
- Added mocked tests for blocked create, declined confirmation, direct create, missing
  labels/templates, missing mapping PR stop, and mapping override creation.

### Changed
- Updated `issues`, `/issue`, `sdlc-operator`, README, and release metadata so
  natural-language requests like "create an Olympus issue from this text" route through prepared
  drafts instead of bypassing readiness checks.
- Bumped plugin and marketplace metadata to `1.6.0`.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-30

### Migration notes
- **No breaking CLI changes.** Existing commands continue to work. Operators should update
  installed cache paths from `mission-control/1.0.0` or `1.4.0` to `mission-control/1.5.0` after
  installing this release.
- Current actionable issue templates use `hermes-task`, `needs-plan`, and the type label.
  `needs-analysis` and `needs-triage` remain documented only as legacy auto-label fallback
  labels from `labels.json`.

### Changed
- Added vendored `config/sdlc-schema.json` and taught board/metric helpers to consume schema-backed boards, workflows, WIP limits, and terminal statuses.
- Added live Jeff Intent (#3) and Asgard (#2) project mappings plus explicit `--project` targeting for board add/move.
- Refreshed board, metrics, milestones, labels, rollout, and operator guidance around Jeff Intent, Asgard, Olympus, direct project fields, and deployment-state separation.
- Preserved read compatibility for live/legacy Olympus statuses such as `In Progress`, `In Development`, and `Deployed` while guiding new movement to the current schema.
- Synced `issues` template guidance with canonical issue forms in `infiquetra-sdlc`, including current Hermes actionable labels and required card sections.
- Added a deterministic template documentation generator plus drift guard tests for `templates-reference.md`.
- Restored legacy rollout WIP-limit fallback when schema-backed limits are absent.
- Aligned `sdlc-operator`, `/triage`, and issue/label references so prompts no longer teach
  stale actionable labels or initiative/objective labels as current practice.
- Bumped plugin and marketplace metadata to `1.5.0`.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-04

### Migration notes
- **No breaking changes.** The `sdlc-operator` Claude Code subagent (`agents/sdlc-operator.md`) was rewritten to reflect 2026-05-04 reality (Phase C minimum-viable + foundation + interactive flow are all merged). Operators using the prior subagent will see the same trigger phrases but newer command examples.

### Changed (Phase C deferred — sdlc-operator subagent rewrite)
- **`agents/sdlc-operator.md`** — full rewrite. The previous version was authored before Phase C; it referenced removed concepts:
  - Beads/Dolt CLI (`bd ready`, `bd claim`, etc. — removed in PR #114; coordination is now Redis pub/sub + GitHub Projects v2 + Discord per-card threads)
  - "2 project boards" (Strategic Direction + Mount Olympus — Strategic Direction was dropped in PR #16 from `infiquetra-sdlc`; Mount Olympus is the only board)
  - `labels sync-fields` command (deprecated — Initiative/Objective are project fields, not labels per PR #16 in `infiquetra-sdlc`. The command itself still exists in the script for back-compat; `flow set-field` is the canonical mechanism. Removing the command is queued for a follow-up after a deprecation cycle.)
  - `initiative:*` / `objective:*` colon-prefixed labels (anti-pattern; removed in PR #11)
- **The rewrite reflects the cumulative Phase C work** — references the `flow` subcommand group (PR #114), per-user defaults file + typed exceptions (PR #115), the sub-issue-first interactive `issue create` flow (PR #116). Each workflow pattern (full issue lifecycle, board grooming, new initiative/objective setup, objective tracking, blueprint-driven batch creation, triage) updated to use the canonical `flow set-field` / `flow link-sub-issue` / `flow verify-label` / `flow validate-card` helpers.
- The `Today's reality (2026-05-04)` callout is repeated in the agent's docstring + the issue-create workflow section — an operator using the agent learns immediately that today only `Status` is a single-select field on the Olympus board, and the `flow` helpers will silently skip prompts for the other fields until they're created via the runbook.

Plugin manifest: 1.3.0 → 1.4.0. **All deferred Phase C items are now closed.**

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-04

### Migration notes
- **No breaking changes.** Existing `issue create --repo X --type Y` invocations work identically; new behavior is additive.
- The new flow is interactive by default. Pass `--skip-metadata` for the prior thin-wrapper behavior (just open browser, no post-create work).
- Operators who ran `config init-defaults` (Phase C foundation) get personalized prompt defaults automatically.

### Added (Phase C deferred — Interactive `issue create` rewrite)

The `issue create` subcommand was rewritten as a sub-issue-first, per-project-schema-aware, defaults-driven, capability-adaptive interactive flow. Replaces the previous thin wrapper that just deferred to `gh issue create --web`.

The 10-step flow:
1. Determine type (decision-tree prompt if `--type` not set; default from `~/.codex/sdlc-defaults.json` if present)
2. **Sub-issue-first prompt**: every new card has a parent by default. Operator pastes a `repo#N` ref or types `no` for free-floating
3. Discover which project the repo maps to (per-user `default_project` preferred, else first match)
4. **Per-project schema discovery**: for each candidate field (Initiative, Objective, Status, plus capability-adaptive ones), check if the project actually exposes the field. Silently skip prompts for fields that don't exist
5. Prompt for field values, defaults seeded from `~/.codex/sdlc-defaults.json` (e.g., `default_initiative`, `default_objective`)
6. **Capability-adaptive fields**: for `capability` or `objective` types only, AND only when the project exposes them, prompt for `Capability Size`, `Business Value`, `Technical Risk`, `Target Quarter`
7. Open `gh issue create --repo X --template <type>.yml --web` in the browser; operator fills the body
8. Operator pastes back the issue number (URL or bare integer accepted); skip post-create metadata if blank
9. **Apply post-create metadata**, each step isolated:
   - `hermes-task` for actionable types / `hermes-not-actionable` for objective
   - `board add` to the project board
   - `flow set-field` for each gathered field value
   - `flow link-sub-issue` if a parent was set
10. **Paired-card prompt** (opt-in, default no): create a sibling card on a different repo with the same parent. Useful for cross-service capabilities (backend + Flutter app)

### New CLI flags
- `--parent-ref <repo#N>`: pre-supply the parent ref (skips the sub-issue prompt — useful for batch-create scripts)
- `--skip-metadata`: skip steps 2-10 entirely, just open the browser. Returns to the prior thin-wrapper UX

### New helpers (composable for tests + scripts)
- `_select_issue_type(default=None)` — decision-tree prompt with EOF-safe fallback
- `_prompt_parent_issue()` — sub-issue-first prompt; parses `repo#N` or `yes` followed by ref
- `_project_field_options(project_name, field_name)` — per-project schema discovery; returns None if field doesn't exist (caller skips silently)
- `_prompt_choice(label, options, default)` — generic field-value prompt with options listed + default + `-` to skip
- `_open_gh_issue_create_web(repo, issue_type)` — browser launch helper
- `_prompt_issue_number(repo)` — captures URL or bare int from operator
- `_apply_post_create_metadata(...)` — orchestrates label / board / fields / sub-issue link with per-step error isolation
- `_prompt_paired_card(repo, issue_number)` — opt-in paired-card prompt; returns target/title/body deltas or None

### Tests
- 23 new tests in `tests/test_issue_create_interactive.py` covering each helper in isolation:
  - `_select_issue_type`: typed choice, default-on-blank, garbage-fallback, EOF-safe
  - `_prompt_parent_issue`: direct ref, yes-then-ref, blank-then-ref, no, garbage-warns, EOF
  - `_prompt_choice`: skip-when-no-field, valid option, default-on-blank, dash-skip, invalid-warns
  - `_prompt_paired_card`: default-no, yes-collects-deltas, yes-empty-target-aborts
  - `_apply_post_create_metadata`: hermes-task for actionable, hermes-not-actionable for objective, label-failure-doesnt-abort-others, no-project-skips-fields-but-keeps-link
  - `_PARENT_REF_RE`: realistic refs accepted; `#42`, `repo-only`, garbage rejected
- Total: **92 / 92 passing**

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-04

### Migration notes
- **No breaking changes.** Existing CLI invocations work identically.
- **Recommended one-time setup**: run `python3 sdlc_manager.py config init-defaults` after upgrading to seed `~/.codex/sdlc-defaults.json` with your gh login + project defaults. Future Phase C PRs will read these as suggestion values in the interactive `issue create` flow.
- **External override still wins**: if you have `$INFIQUETRA_SDLC_PATH/config/project-mappings.json`, it continues to take precedence over the new vendored copy.
- **Exception class names changed (PEP 8 / N818)**: `ApiNotFound` → `ApiNotFoundError`, `ApiAlreadyExists` → `ApiAlreadyExistsError`, `ApiRateLimited` → `ApiRateLimitedError`. Backward-compat aliases retained for the old names; can be removed in a follow-up after a deprecation cycle.

### Added (Phase C deferred — Foundation)

- **Typed exception classes** (`GhApiError`, `ApiNotFound`, `ApiAlreadyExists`, `ApiRateLimited`, `ApiAuthError`, `CardValidationError`). `_gh` now raises the appropriate subclass via `_classify_gh_error` instead of bare `RuntimeError` with a stringy message. Replaces the fragile `"422" in str(e)` substring matching pattern. Downstream callers catch by type:
  ```python
  try:
      _rest_post(...)
  except ApiAlreadyExists:
      # idempotent re-run — treat as success
  ```
  The `flow_link_sub_issue` and `flow_verify_label` helpers were refactored to use this pattern. `flow_verify_label` also now handles a real race (two operators creating the same label simultaneously) via `ApiAlreadyExists` on POST.
- **Per-user defaults file** at `~/.codex/sdlc-defaults.json`. Stores: `assignee` (gh login from `gh api user --jq .login` — *not* OS `$USER`), `default_project`, `default_status`, `default_priority`, `default_initiative`, `default_objective`, `preferred_repos`. Sticky across CLI invocations; future interactive flows read defaults as suggestion values.
  - `load_user_defaults()` / `save_user_defaults()` helpers (atomic write via tempfile + rename; tolerant of missing file + malformed JSON)
  - `get_default(key)` convenience reader
  - New subcommands:
    - `config show-defaults` — display current per-user defaults
    - `config init-defaults [--non-interactive]` — first-run wizard. Interactive by default; `--non-interactive` seeds from `gh api user` + auto-detects `default_project` if exactly one project is mapped (no guessing on multi-project orgs).
- **Vendored `project-mappings.json`** at `plugins/mission-control/config/project-mappings.json`. The plugin now works without an external `infiquetra-sdlc` checkout for canonical Infiquetra projects.
  - New `_resolve_project_mappings(sdlc_path)` helper implements the documented resolution order: external override (`$INFIQUETRA_SDLC_PATH/config/project-mappings.json`) → vendored canonical → remote `gh api` fallback.
  - Project node IDs captured in the vendored file are best-effort + verified 2026-05-04. Field/option IDs are NEVER cached; always fetched live.

### Tests
- 33 new tests across 3 new test files:
  - `test_typed_exceptions.py` (15 tests) — status-code parsing (404/401/403/429/422 disambiguation), 422-already-exists vs 422-validation-failure distinction, integration with `flow_link_sub_issue` + `flow_verify_label` (including race detection)
  - `test_user_defaults.py` (13 tests) — read-side (missing file, malformed JSON, non-object root, unset key), write-side (atomic via tmpfile+rename, parent-dir auto-create, round-trip), `--non-interactive` wizard (gh-login seeded, multi-project no-guess, preserves unknown future keys)
  - `test_project_mappings_resolution.py` (5 tests) — override wins over vendored, vendored used when no override, remote fallback when neither, empty dict on all-three failure, vendored file declares expected canonical state
- Updated 3 PR #114 tests in `test_flow_subcommands.py` to use typed exceptions instead of bare `RuntimeError` with string-matching (the old pattern was testing the old implementation; new tests test the new contract).
- Total: **64 / 64 passing** locally.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed (during PR #114 review)
- **`validate_card_body` header text**: was `"Out-of-scope or non-goals"` (with "or"); home-lab card_validator.py and ALL actionable issue templates use `"Out-of-scope / non-goals"` (with "/"). Every real card would have failed validation with a phantom missing-section error. Corrected to match home-lab exactly. Same iteration also corrects `_PATH_LINE_RE` (now accepts plain filenames + bullet-prefixed paths matching home-lab) and `_CHECKLIST_RE` (now requires `\S` after `[ ]` and accepts `*` bullets matching home-lab).
- **Drift-guard test**: added `test_required_headers_match_actual_issue_templates` that loads the real issue templates and verifies every `_REQUIRED_H3_HEADERS` entry has a matching `label:` in capability/enhancement/defect.yml. This is the test that would have caught the original "or" vs "/" bug.
- **Pre-existing test breakage**: `tests/test_sdlc_manager.py` had a `TestBeadsClaim` class referencing the deleted `beads_claim` function. Class deleted; CHANGELOG note added in the test file.
- **WIP-limits test fixture**: was using the old `beads_config` config-key (which now degrades to `{}`); the override test passed only by coincidence. Renamed fixture to `legacy_rollout_config`; tightened assertion to verify the OVERRIDDEN column (Ready) renders with the override limit, not just any column happening to have a "5" in its render.
- **`flow_validate_card` exit-code path**: was calling `sys.exit(1)` directly, bypassing main()'s formatted-error path and breaking programmatic callers. Now raises `CardValidationError` (RuntimeError subclass) which main() catches; preserves the standard CLI exit code behavior + lets future callers inspect the failure.
- **`_resolve_project_field` error message**: now includes a hint pointing at the field-creation runbook in `infiquetra-sdlc/docs/operations/operational-reference.md` when a field doesn't exist.
- **Stale `# BEADS` banner**: removed (Beads removal had left an empty banner in the argparse section).
- **Duplicate `import re`**: removed (validator block had a redundant import; top-level `import re` at line 61 already covers it).
- **Unused `project_id_check` variable**: replaced with `_, items = ...` discard idiom (consistent with `board_wip` pattern).
- **README.md**: removed the "Beads coordination" capability bullet + stale `bd` CLI prerequisite + stale `Beads Operations` section + stale `config/beads-config.json` row. Added `Flow Operations` section with the 6 new commands.

### Added
- New `flow` subcommand group — operator-facing GraphQL + REST helpers:
  - `flow set-field` — set a single-select project field on a card (Initiative, Objective, Status, etc.)
  - `flow field-options` — list current options for a project field (live discovery, IDs not cached)
  - `flow discover-project` — resolve which project a repo maps to
  - `flow link-sub-issue` — link child as native sub-issue of parent (cross-repo, idempotent)
  - `flow verify-label` — self-healing label create (404 → create, exists → no-op, other errors raise)
  - `flow validate-card` — pre-flight check an existing issue body against the card_validator schema
- New `validate_card_body()` Python helper — mirrors home-lab card_validator.py's high-leverage checks (6 required H3 headers, AC has ≥1 checklist, Verification has ≥1 fenced code block, Files-expected has ≥1 path-like line, no placeholder-only sections)
- New `flow` skill (SKILL.md) describing the `flow` commands + idempotency contract + hard rules + integration with the blueprint-to-issue workflow
- 20 tests in `tests/test_card_validator.py` and `tests/test_flow_subcommands.py` covering: validator schema rules, idempotency contracts, error classification (404 vs auth vs server), live-discovery vs cached, helpful error messages with current options listed

### Changed
- Renamed `beads_config` config-key to `legacy_rollout_config` in `load_config` and downstream readers (`board_wip`, `rollout_status`, `rollout_update`, `config_show`). The underlying file (`beads-config.json`) was already removed from infiquetra-sdlc on 2026-04-26; the key now degrades gracefully to `{}` for back-compat. Comment in `load_config` documents the migration.

### Removed
- `beads` subcommand group (`ready`, `claim`, `update`, `complete`, `status`)
- `_bd` shell helper for invoking the `bd` CLI
- All `beads_*` Python functions
- The Beads/Dolt coordination layer was removed from Mount Olympus on 2026-04-26 (see `infiquetra-sdlc/docs/engineering-journal/narratives/2026-04-26-beads-dolt-removed.md`); the agent fleet now coordinates via Redis pub/sub + GitHub Projects v2 + Discord per-card threads. The plugin's `beads` commands targeted infrastructure that no longer exists.

### Migration notes
- Operators previously running `sdlc_manager.py beads <action>` will get an `argparse` error. There is no replacement — the underlying coordination has moved off Beads entirely. Use `gh` + the new `flow` commands for direct board operations.
- The `flow set-field` command is the canonical mechanism for Initiative + Objective assignment per the 2026-05-03 DECISION (see `infiquetra-sdlc/docs/engineering-journal/DECISIONS.md`). The fields don't exist on the Olympus board today; create them via the operator runbook in `operational-reference.md` before using `flow set-field`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-29

### Added
- Initial release of mission-control plugin for the Mount Olympus agent team
- Updated wording to use Infiquetra conventions consistently
- 6 skills: board, issues, labels, metrics, milestones, rollout
- 4 commands: /board, /issue, /metrics, /triage
- 1 agent: sdlc-operator
- Python CLI: sdlc_manager.py (zero external dependencies, gh CLI wrapper)
- New: beads resource group for Beads/Dolt task coordination
- Removed: Rally sync, GHE hostname requirements, Chainproofers/Identifiers team split
- Coordination model: Beads-first with GitHub Issues as backing store
- Notifications: Discord (not Slack)
- 2 project boards: Strategic Direction + Mount Olympus Operations
