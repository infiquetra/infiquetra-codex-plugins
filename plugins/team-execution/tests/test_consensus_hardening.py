"""Drift-guard tests for the Layer B consensus contract (consensus hardening, U8).

architecture-reviewer.toml and consensus-protocol.md are the executable spec the reviewer agent
follows (KTD7) — there is no scoring engine to unit-test, so these assert the contract text itself:
the fabricated N/A->8.0 default is gone, the applicable-dimensions denominator is defined, and a
static exclusion is never a failure signal. Adapted to the Codex layout (reviewer prompts are TOML).
