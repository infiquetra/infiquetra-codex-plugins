  Operator-facing GraphQL + REST helpers for the active project boards. Wraps
  the GitHub APIs the orchestrator uses, so Jeff can do per-card work
  (set Initiative/Objective fields, link or unlink sub-issues, validate card bodies,
  self-heal labels, discover project mappings, assign covered issues to Team Mimir) without writing GraphQL by
  hand. Each command is idempotent where possible, and surfaces partial
  failures clearly.
when_to_use: |
  Use this skill when the user wants to:

  Set Initiative or Objective on a card (project FIELDS, not labels):
  - "Set Initiative on this card to campps-quality"
  - "Mark this issue as part of the Auth MVP Objective"
  - "Update the Objective field on campps-mvp#42"

  Discover what fields/options exist on a project (live, not cached):
  - "What Initiative options exist?"
  - "List the Objective field options"
  - "What can I set Initiative to?"

  Find which project a repo belongs to:
  - "Which project does athena-service map to?"
  - "Where do I add cards from this repo?"

  Assign an issue to Team Mimir intake:
  - "Assign this issue to Mimir"
  - "Send infiquetra/mimir-pilot-claude-plugins#42 through Mimir intake"

  Link a child issue as a sub-issue of a parent:
  - "Link #43 as a sub-issue of #42"
  - "Make this a child of campps-context-library#1"
  - "Set up the parent/child relationship between these issues"

  Remove an accidental or retired parent layer:
  - "Unlink #43 from #42"
  - "Make this capability top-level again"
  - "Remove the redundant outcome parent without closing either issue"

  Self-heal missing labels (so other operations don't fail mid-flow):
  - "Make sure the high-priority label exists on campps-mvp"
  - "Verify hermes-task is on this repo's label set"
  - "Create the capability label if it's missing"

  Pre-flight an issue body against the card_validator schema:
  - "Validate the card body for #42"
  - "Will this issue pass plan-review?"
  - "Check if my issue body matches the card_validator contract"

  Don't use this skill for:
  - Creating issues (use `issues:create`)
  - Moving cards between Status columns (use `board:move`)
  - General board health (use `board:view`)

  These are *helpers*, not full workflows. The full issue-creation and optional-parent
  card-creation workflow is in `infiquetra-sdlc/docs/workflows/blueprint-to-issue.md`;
  this skill provides the building blocks the workflow uses.

# flow

Operator-facing helpers over the GraphQL + REST APIs CAMPPS uses.
Each command is a thin wrapper with idempotency + clear error messages.

## Commands

```bash
# Set a single-select project field on a card
sdlc_manager.py flow set-field \
  --project campps --repo campps-mvp --number 42 \
  --field Initiative --option campps-quality

# List the options on a project field (live discovery — IDs rotate)
sdlc_manager.py flow field-options \
  --project campps --field Objective

# Resolve which project a repo maps to
sdlc_manager.py flow discover-project --repo athena-service

# Apply the live-covered repository's existing Mimir intake trigger
sdlc_manager.py flow assign-mimir \
  --repo mimir-pilot-claude-plugins --number 42

# Link child as native sub-issue of parent (cross-repo OK; idempotent)
sdlc_manager.py flow link-sub-issue \
  --parent-repo campps-context-library --parent-number 1 \
  --child-repo campps-mvp --child-number 42

# Remove only the native relationship (cross-repo OK; idempotent)
sdlc_manager.py flow unlink-sub-issue \
  --parent-repo campps-context-library --parent-number 1 \
  --child-repo campps-mvp --child-number 42

# Self-healing label: 404 → create; exists → no-op; other errors raise
sdlc_manager.py flow verify-label \
  --repo campps-mvp --name high-priority \
  --color D93F0B --description "High priority"

# Pre-flight a card body against the card_validator schema
sdlc_manager.py flow validate-card --repo campps-mvp --number 42
```

## Idempotency contract (per command)

| Command | Idempotent? | Failure behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `set-field` | yes (same option = same final state) | Raises if option doesn't exist; error message lists current options |
| `field-options` | read-only | Raises if project or field doesn't exist |
| `discover-project` | read-only | Returns "not mapped" or "excluded" without erroring |
| `assign-mimir` | yes (existing trigger label = no mutation) | Reads live Team Mimir coverage, open-issue state, current principal authority, and the existing trigger label before mutation; verifies label and Objective state after mutation. Unsupported, closed, unauthorized, missing-label, or unreadable cases fail closed. |
| `link-sub-issue` | yes (re-POST returns 422 "already exists" → success) | Raises on non-422 errors; rejects PR-as-parent |
| `unlink-sub-issue` | yes (verified issues + absent relationship returns 404 -> success) | Verifies both issues first; rejects PR-as-parent; propagates auth/rate-limit/server errors |
| `verify-label` | yes (no-op if exists; create if 404) | Raises on auth/rate-limit/server errors (NOT silently treated as missing) |
| `validate-card` | read-only | Exits non-zero if card body fails validation |

## Hard rules

- **Objective is a project field plus scorecard, not an issue type or parent requirement.** Never apply a plain `objective` type label or `objective:*` / `initiative:*` colon-prefixed labels. Use `flow set-field` instead.
- **Field option IDs rotate on rename/recreate.** Never cache them. Every command that reads field state calls `flow field-options` (or its equivalent GraphQL query) at start.
- **Verify-label distinguishes 404 from other errors.** A 401/403/5xx must NOT be silently treated as missing — that would create labels under the wrong auth context or mask real failures.
- **Link only real decomposition.** Capabilities are top-level by default and grouped by the `Objective` field. Both sub-issue commands require an issue parent; PRs are rejected.
- **Assign-Mimir never creates policy.** It does not admit repositories, create `intake:mimir`, use alternate credentials, or comment. Team Mimir's live exact-repository coverage and the repository-owned label must already exist.

## Where this fits in the broader workflow

The Phase A carry-over #2 decision (Initiative + Objective as CAMPPS
project fields) made `flow set-field` the canonical mechanism for hierarchy
assignment. The blueprint-to-issue workflow calls into:

- `flow link-sub-issue` / `flow unlink-sub-issue` (optional decomposition relationship)
- `flow set-field` (Initiative + Objective + Status fields)

`validate-card` is the pre-flight check before plan-review fires. If a card
body doesn't pass `validate-card`, the orchestrator will reject it on the
target board's active-work transition; running this command before moving the
card forward saves a round-trip.

## Authoritative source

The card_validator schema is mirrored from
`home-lab/ansible/roles/hermes_orchestrator/files/card_validator.py`. When
that file's contract changes, update `validate_card_body` in
`scripts/sdlc_manager.py` to match.
