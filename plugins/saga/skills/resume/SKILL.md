description: The Infiquetra lifecycle's HEAVY forensic reconstruction engine — the deep half beside /loop's lightweight restore. Two tiers — Tier 1 reconstructs from the saga's WHOLE tick-chain trajectory (not just the last frame) plus PR archaeology and explicit conflict reconciliation; Tier 2 (fallback only, no saga AND no resolvable issue) is a slim source-only port of CE session forensics over local JSONL logs. Read-only on the world; it writes one git-ignored re-entry tick that reuses the restored saga_id, then routes. Triggers on "resume", "reconstruct what happened", "what was tried across these PRs", a corrupt or missing local cache, or same-machine work that never wrote a saga.

# Resume

`/resume` answers **"What actually happened here, across the whole history — and where do I re-enter?"**
It is the lifecycle's **heavy forensic reconstruction engine**: the deep dig that runs when a thread is
tangled across many rounds and PRs, when the local cache is corrupt or absent, or when same-machine work
ran before any saga was ever written. It reconstructs the full trajectory, reconciles conflicts against
the durable source of truth, and then **routes** to the one command that owns the next phase. It does
**not** build, plan, review, file issues, or deploy — it reconstructs and hands off.

`/resume` is the **deep half beside `/loop`**. `/loop` already does the lightweight restore (latest tick)
and the inline cold reconstruction (`load_saga_context.py` + reading `docs/*`) — see
`../loop/references/drive-and-resume.md` (the Resume contract). `/loop` **offers** `/resume` as an
opt-in only when the lightweight path is not enough. `/resume` is what it offers: the all-ticks
trajectory read, deeper PR archaeology, conflict reconciliation, and — as a last resort — JSONL session
forensics. It never routes back to `/loop` (no ping-pong); it routes forward to the owning command.

## Position in the lifecycle

`/resume` sits beside `/loop` as the resume substrate's **forensic** tier:

- `/loop` answers: "Where does this go, and what's already in flight?" (lightweight scan / restore / route)
- **`/resume` answers: "What happened across the whole history, and where do I re-enter?"** (this engine)
- the destination command (`/work`, `/handoff`, …) answers its own phase question once routed to

`/loop` does the cheap restore inline; `/resume` is the expensive dig `/loop` defers to. The two
reconcile **identically** — they inherit the same durability precedence (committed `docs/*` + GitHub
authoritative; the git-ignored saga cache is the anchor, not the authority). The only difference is
depth: `/resume` reads the whole tick chain, not the last frame.

## Core principles

1. **Reconstruct from the durable source of truth.** Committed `docs/*` and GitHub issue / PR state are
   authoritative; the git-ignored saga cache in `.codex/saga/` is the **anchor, not the
   authority**. This is the **existing** precedence — `../loop/references/drive-and-resume.md` lines
   108-111 and `../../references/saga-spec.md` §10 — **inherited, not reinvented**, so `/loop` and
   `/resume` reconcile a stale cache against a merged PR the same way.
2. **Read the WHOLE trajectory, not the last frame.** Tier 1 reads **all** saga ticks oldest -> newest
   (the new `ticks` reader) and reconciles them via the §6 full-snapshot semantics — answered questions
   dropped off, cleared blockers vanished, phase regressions surfaced. This all-ticks read **plus**
   deeper PR archaeology **plus** explicit conflict reconciliation is what makes `/resume` deeper than
   `/loop`. `load_saga_context.py` and reading `docs/*` are **shared substrate** `/loop` already runs —
   they are **not** the differentiator. (See `references/forensic-reconstruction.md`.)
3. **Reconcile conflicts explicitly, operator-confirmed.** When the cache disagrees with reality — a
   stale `lifecycle_phase` vs a merged PR, an open blocker the PR already cleared — surface the conflict,
   apply the precedence (committed + GitHub win), and confirm the reconciled state with the operator
   before routing. Never silently trust the cache.
4. **Zero-save JSONL forensics is the last resort, context-safe by construction.** Tier 2 fires **only**
   when there is no saga AND no resolvable issue. The **orchestrator NEVER Reads or cats a raw `.jsonl`
   or a skeleton file.** Discovery returns paths; extraction is **file-mediated** to a scratch dir; a
   **GENERIC synthesis agent** (its own context window) reads the extracts via paths and returns prose.
   Cap 5 sessions; exclude the current session; never reproduce tool I/O or thinking blocks.
   (See `references/session-forensics.md`.)
5. **Read-only on the WORLD; one git-ignored tick is the only write.** `/resume` reads code, issues, PRs,
   and the board but mutates none of them. Its **single write** is one re-entry saga tick that **REUSES
   the restored saga_id** (never a paraphrase-derived id). It mints a new saga **only** in the Tier-2
   no-saga branch. **Never `git add`** the tick — saga state is git-ignored, machine-local.
6. **Route, don't execute.** `/resume` reconstructs and then routes to the one command that owns the next
   phase, via the **shared** `../loop/references/dispatch-table.md` (referenced, never duplicated). The
   common case is `/work` (resume the round-N loop) or `/handoff` (let another session pick it up). It
   never builds, never files issues, and **never routes back to `/loop`** — no ping-pong.

## Interaction method

Use `Codex blocking question` for choices from a known set (which saga thread when several match, resume-vs-fresh,
the reconciled-state confirmation, the route destination). Call `ToolSearch` with
`blocking question` first if its schema is not loaded. Ask one question per turn; prefer a concise
single-select. For open-ended discussion, ask inline.

In a channel session (`redis-channel` active), `Codex blocking question` cannot be called — inline the choices in
your reply text instead. Follow the canonical channel-inline convention in
`saga/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (do not duplicate its wording here).

Use repo-relative paths in every routing tick and every reference to a committed doc. Absolute paths
break portability across machines and worktrees. (The Tier-2 scratch dir from `mktemp` is the one
deliberate absolute path — it is throwaway, machine-local, and never committed.)

---

## Phase 0 — Enter, scan, classify the tier

Capture the input and decide which tier the run is before reconstructing anything.

The input is a GitHub issue reference, a plan / doc path, a set of PR numbers, the word `resume`, or a
bare "reconstruct what happened" ask. Take it from command arguments or the active artifact. If empty,
ask: "What should I reconstruct? Point me at the issue, a plan/doc path, the PRs, or describe the work."

Scan the saga log to find in-flight candidates:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py scan
```

`scan` returns one candidate per saga (latest tick each), newest-first by filename, each surfacing
`lifecycle_phase` / `phase_status` / `status` / `destination` / `issue_ref` / `plan_path` / `branch` /
the orchestration pointer. Classify the run:

- **matched-saga** — a candidate matches the thread (`issue_ref`, `plan_path`, `branch`, or operator
  confirmation) -> **Tier 1** (Phase 1 -> 2 -> 3a -> 4 -> 5).
- **resolvable-issue** — no matching saga, but the input names a GitHub issue (or one resolves via
  `state.json.sagas[*].issue_ref` ending in `#N`) -> **Tier 1** via PR archaeology + the issue
  (Phase 2's `load_saga_context.py` / `saga.py context` path).
- **NEITHER** — no matching saga AND no resolvable issue -> **Tier 2** (Phase 3b), the last-resort JSONL
  session forensics.

---

## Phase 1 — Select the thread (Tier 1)

Pick the one saga thread to reconstruct and **capture its EXACT `saga_id`** — carry that literal id to
Phase 5; never re-derive it from a paraphrase of the task.

- If `scan` surfaced **one** matching candidate, select it.
- If **several** match, disambiguate with `Codex blocking question` (single-select over the candidate list:
  `saga_id` + `lifecycle_phase` + `issue_ref` + `updated_at`).
- For an issue whose `issue-<N>` directory is absent, resolve the id via `state.json.sagas[*].issue_ref`
  ending in `#N` — the id is **sticky**; **never** rename the directory (slug-instability guard,
  `../../references/saga-spec.md` §2.3 / §2.1).
- If **no** candidate matches **and** there is **no** resolvable issue, fall through to **Tier 2**
  (Phase 3b).

---

## Phase 2 — Tier 1: deep saga reconstruction

Read the **whole** trajectory, then the shared archaeology substrate, then the committed docs the ticks
point at.

**The all-ticks trajectory (the deeper-than-`/loop` capability):**

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py ticks --saga-id <issue-N|task-slug>
```

`ticks` returns **every** tick oldest -> newest, full envelope each — the trajectory `/loop`'s
latest-tick-only `restore` cannot see (how the phase advanced, when blockers cleared, which questions got
answered). Reconcile the chain via the §6 snapshot semantics (`references/forensic-reconstruction.md`).

**The latest-tick anchor:**

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py restore --saga-id <issue-N|task-slug>
```

`restore` is the current-state anchor (latest tick, cold, no git / network) — the starting point the
trajectory explains how you reached.

**The shared archaeology substrate** (the same calls `/loop` runs inline — substrate, not the
differentiator), for an issue-backed thread:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/load_saga_context.py --repo <owner/repo> --issue <N>
```

and / or the lower-level aggregate:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py context --repo <owner/repo> --issue <N>
```

Both aggregate round-tagged prior PRs (`reviewDecision` / `mergedAt` / round), ADR refs, and matching
journal sections. Then **read the committed `docs/*` the ticks point at** (`plan_path`,
`work_session_paths`, `review_paths`, `qa_paths`) — those are the durable truth; the cache is the anchor.

---

## Phase 3a — Reconcile and synthesize (Tier 1)

Reconcile the trajectory (all ticks) against the PR reality (`reviewDecision` / `mergedAt` / round) and
the committed docs, then produce the reconstructed state:

- **Workflow repair check** — if a restored tick carries canonical `verified-workflow` or legacy
  `team-execution`, validate the restored ref with its original mode before routing:

  ```bash
  python3 plugins/saga/scripts/verified_workflow_readiness.py validate \
    --mode <verified-workflow|team-execution> \
    --ref <orchestration_ref> \
    --context resume \
    --plan-path docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md
  ```

  Detect and name these contradictions: empty ref, missing Workflow Structure, generic-subagent evidence
  presented as role-attested, inline prose with workflow metadata, mixed canonical/legacy roots, and stale
  instruction roots.
  Treat stale instruction roots conservatively: flag them only when the tick chain or committed
  artifacts name an installed cache root such as `.codex/plugins/cache/...`, name a Saga or workflow
  version older than the repo source being read, or otherwise point to non-repo
  instructions. When stale instruction roots are suspected, reread current repo skill files before
  routing.

  If the canonical ref is ready, route the reconstructed state to `/work` for Verified Workflows.
  Legacy-ready evidence remains labeled read-only and cannot attest a new run. If blocked, repair the
  evidence, record an explicit `orchestration_downgrade` rationale, or halt for the operator. Do not preserve workflow metadata while routing to an inline execution
  path.
- **phase / destination** — the current `lifecycle_phase` / `phase_status`, the `destination` class.
- **blockers** — open vs cleared (a blocker a later tick or a merged PR resolved is **cleared**, not open).
- **open questions** — open vs answered (snapshot semantics: an answered question dropped off a later tick).
- **checks** — what tests / gates ran (latest snapshot).
- **next-step** — the one imperative resume anchor.

**Conflicts resolve toward the durable side.** If the cached `lifecycle_phase` says `work` but a PR for
this round is merged, the committed + GitHub state wins; the cache was stale. Surface every conflict
explicitly and confirm the reconciled state with the operator (Interaction method) before routing.

---

## Phase 3b — Tier 2: zero-save JSONL session forensics (FALLBACK ONLY)

Fires **only** when Phase 0 found **no saga AND no resolvable issue** — same-machine work that never
wrote a saga: raw sessions, pre-saga-adoption work, or a session that crashed before its first tick.
This is **not** the "fresh clone on a new machine" case (there the local session logs are simply absent —
fall back to the committed `docs/*` instead). Tier 2 is a slim source-only port of CE session forensics.

**The HARD context-safety guardrail:** the **orchestrator NEVER Reads or cats a raw `.jsonl` or a
skeleton file.** ONLY the generic synthesis agent reads skeletons, and ONLY via paths. **Never** paste
extract content into the dispatch prompt. (Full recipe + the CE guardrails: `references/session-forensics.md`.)

1. **Scratch dir** (throwaway, machine-local):

   ```bash
   SCRATCH=$(mktemp -d -t resume-sessions-XXXXXX)
   ```

2. **Discover** sessions for this repo, recency-ranked, capped at 5, current session excluded.
   `--exclude` is **mandatory** here — `discover_sessions.py` does **not** auto-detect the current
   session, so without the flag the current session is returned, extracted, and synthesized, violating
   the "Never analyze the current session" guardrail and burning a cap slot. `<current-session-id>` is
   this session's own `*.jsonl` basename under `~/.codex/sessions/<repo>/` (drop the `.jsonl`):

   ```bash
   python3 plugins/saga/scripts/discover_sessions.py --repo <repo-folder> --days <N> --exclude <current-session-id>
   ```

   The orchestrator reads only the path list + one-line `_meta` (no session content).

3. **Extract** each session's skeleton **file-mediated** to scratch (the orchestrator sees only the
   one-line `_meta` status — never the skeleton bytes):

   ```bash
   python3 plugins/saga/scripts/extract_session_skeleton.py --output "$SCRATCH/<id>.skeleton.txt" < <session-file>
   ```

4. **Dispatch a GENERIC synthesis agent** (`Explore` / `Task` — this plugin has **no** `agents/` dir, so
   do **not** reference a named `ce-*` / `resume-session-historian` agent; mirror `/code-review` SKILL
   line 164). Pass the scratch **paths** + the historian guardrails as prompt text: read ONLY these
   paths, never read raw `~/.codex/sessions/`, never invoke `Skill`, never reproduce tool I/O or thinking
   blocks, synthesize *what was tried / what didn't work / key decisions / related context*.

5. Optional explicit cleanup (the OS reclaims it regardless):

   ```bash
   rm -rf "$SCRATCH"
   ```

The synthesized prose feeds the route decision (Phase 4). Tier 2 writes a **new** saga in Phase 5 (the
one branch where minting is correct).

---

## Phase 4 — Route per the shared dispatch table

Route from the reconstructed `lifecycle_phase` / `phase_status` (Tier 1) or the synthesized state
(Tier 2) to the one command that owns the next phase, using the **shared**
`../loop/references/dispatch-table.md` (saga-spec §11). **Read** that table; do **not** restate it here —
one source of truth keeps `/loop` and `/resume` routing identical.

The common case is `/work` (resume the round-N loop on a `resume-ready` thread) or `/handoff` (when
another team / later session should pick the recovered work up). Announce the chosen command with a
one-line reason. **Never route back to `/loop`** — `/resume` is the forward path off `/loop`'s opt-in,
not a return ticket.

---

## Phase 5 — Write the one re-entry tick

Write exactly **one** re-entry tick recording the reconstructed state + the routing decision. **REUSE the
restored `saga_id` verbatim** — pass it through `--saga-id` (`save` accepts `--saga-id` as an explicit
override that **bypasses derivation entirely**, saga-spec §2.3; `--kind`/`--id` are then carried through
unchanged for the record). `save` mints a new saga dir unconditionally for any id it has not seen
(saga-spec §2.3 + §6), so a re-derived paraphrase forks a phantom thread — and so does the **prefix trap**:
`restore` exposes the prefixed `saga_id` (`task-<slug>`) AND the un-slugified original `id`; passing the
prefixed `saga_id` as `--id` re-derives `task-task-<slug>` and forks. The `--saga-id` override sidesteps
both. Use the EXACT id `restore` reported (`issue-<N>` / `task-<slug>`). Carry `lifecycle_phase`
**forward** (never clobber a consumer's phase); **never** set `next_round` (derived, §6.1):

Before writing this tick, run the Phase 3a workflow readiness validation for any reconstructed
canonical or legacy workflow state. The tick must carry repaired executable state, an explicit
downgrade rationale, or a halted operator-facing blocker; it must not write fresh metadata-only
workflow re-entry.

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py save \
  --saga-id <exact restored saga_id, e.g. issue-42 or task-refactor-the-thing> \
  --kind <issue|task> \
  --id <restored issue number, or the restored task id WITHOUT the task- prefix> \
  --lifecycle-phase <reconstructed-phase> \
  --phase-status <pending|in_progress|complete> \
  --status paused \
  --destination <plan-only|pr|merge|nonprod-deploy> \
  --next-step "<the one imperative resume anchor: the command being routed to>" \
  --issue-ref <owner/repo#N> \
  --plan-path docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md \
  --rounds-seen "<observed rounds, pipe-separated; e.g. 1|2>" \
  --blockers "<reconciled open blockers, empty if cleared>" \
  --summary "<the reconstructed-state one-paragraph>"
```

- `--status paused` is the default re-entry disposition (or `active` if continuing in-session).
  Use `handed-off` **only** when routing to `/handoff` — and then also build the envelope
  (`handoff_envelope.py`, per `/loop`'s Phase 4.2).
- Minting a **new** saga is correct **only** in the Tier-2 no-saga branch (there is no restored id to
  reuse). In Tier 1, always reuse via `--saga-id` — for Tier 2, omit `--saga-id` and let derivation mint
  the fresh id from `--kind`/`--id`.
- **Never `git add`** the tick.

---

## Boundary negatives

`/resume` reconstructs and routes. It does **NOT**:

- build, test, or open / merge a PR (-> `/work`);
- file SDLC issues (-> `/handoff` / `mission-control`);
- deploy (-> `deploy`);
- add an `agents/` dir or a custom subagent — Tier 2 uses **generic** `Explore` / `Task` agents
  (mirror `/code-review` SKILL line 164);
- re-port gstack's context save/restore — that **is** the saga (`scripts/saga.py`), already shipped;
- adopt a `[gstack-context]` commit trailer or any commit-side state;
- duplicate the dispatch table — it **references** `../loop/references/dispatch-table.md`;
- route back to `/loop` — no `/loop` <-> `/resume` ping-pong;
- mutate code, issues, PRs, or the board — it is **read-only on the world**, with its one git-ignored
  re-entry tick as the sole write.
