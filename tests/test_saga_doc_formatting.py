"""Structural formatting gate for saga doc-writing skills (issue #201).

This test enforces the shared formatting contract in
``plugins/saga/references/formatting-style.md`` so the generated-document
formatting cannot silently regress. It only reads markdown, so it adds no
``plugins/`` line coverage — that is expected; there is no ``--cov-fail-under``
gate (see ``pyproject.toml``).

What it checks:

1. No template/format file stacks bold-label lines without a blank line between
   them (the CommonMark collapse that produced "all jumbled together").
2. Each of the nine doc-writing skills links the shared contract somewhere in
   its skill directory.
3. The shared contract's golden specimen passes the same collapse check.

It deliberately does NOT check soft-wrap: rule 5 is a generated-output rule, and
the template *source* files in this repo stay hard-wrapped and editor-friendly.
