# Decisions

## 2026-05-27: Curated Codex Adapter Repo

`infiquetra-codex-plugins` is a Codex-native adapter repo, not a mirror of the Claude or
Antigravity repos. The active surface is Codex manifests and skills. Claude command files,
top-level agent files, and host manifests are excluded unless a future Codex-native design
explicitly adds an equivalent.

## 2026-05-27: Preserve Lineage Versions

MVP plugin versions preserve the source/cache lineage versions. `sdlc-manager` uses 1.4.0
because that is the Codex-visible cache version and source plugin manifest version.

## 2026-05-27: Cache Is Installed State Only

Installed cache paths define the behavioral baseline but must not be edited as maintained
source. Repo-managed installs can replace cache-managed usage only after documented gates pass.

## 2026-06-06: Saga-Family Replacement Is Gated

The Codex baseline will move from `sdlc-manager` and `blueprint-reviewer` to
`saga`, `deploy`, `mission-control`, and `team-execution`, but the old active
plugins are not deleted until source baseline, capability mapping, known-use
inventory, staged validation, and isolated Codex proof gates pass.

The source snapshot for this replacement is
`infiquetra-claude-plugins@16de95c82ccb2ed80d7f11018e1c2e8247a80a7f`.
Claude command files, agent files, and `.claude-plugin` manifests remain
lineage only. Codex-active ports must be skills, references, scripts, tests,
config, docs, and `.codex-plugin` manifests.
