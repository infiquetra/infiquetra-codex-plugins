## Convention-Based Labels

These labels follow a naming convention and are created on-demand rather than pre-deployed.

### `initiative:*` and `objective:*`

Applied to issues to associate them with a program-level initiative or delivery objective.
Synced to project board single-select fields via `labels sync-fields`.

| Pattern | Color | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `initiative:{name}` | `#0052CC` (blue) | `initiative:olympus-v1` |
| `objective:{name}` | `#0052CC` (blue) | `objective:platform-launch` |

---

## Meta Labels

Organizational and process labels.

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|

| `help-wanted` | `#008672` (green) | Extra attention or expertise needed |
| `duplicate` | `#CFD3D7` (gray) | This issue or PR already exists |
| `wontfix` | `#FFFFFF` (white) | This will not be worked on |
| `invalid` | `#E4E4E4` (light gray) | This doesn't seem right or is not applicable |
| `question` | `#D876E3` (purple) | Further information is requested |
| `epic` | `#3E4B9E` (navy) | Large initiative spanning multiple capabilities |

---

## Auto-Label Rules

Applied by `labels auto-label` command. Rules match patterns in issue title or body.

| Rule | Pattern (regex) | Labels Applied |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| `title_contains_capability` | `\[CAPABILITY\]` in title | `capability`, `needs-analysis` |
| `title_contains_enhancement` | `\[ENHANCEMENT\]` in title | `enhancement`, `needs-analysis` |
| `title_contains_defect` | `\[DEFECT\]` in title | `defect`, `needs-triage` |
| `title_contains_exploration` | `\[EXPLORATION\]` in title | `exploration` |
| `title_contains_context` | `\[CONTEXT\]` in title | `context-update`, `documentation` |
| `mentions_security` | `security\|vulnerability\|CVE` in title/body | `security` |
| `mentions_performance` | `performance\|latency\|slow\|timeout` in title/body | `performance` |
| `mentions_breaking` | `breaking change\|breaking\|backwards incompatible` in title/body | `breaking-change` |

## Usage Rules Summary

1. **Every issue must have exactly ONE issue type label**: `capability`, `enhancement`,
   `defect`, `exploration`, or `context-update`

2. **Defects must have exactly ONE priority label**: `critical`, `high-priority`,
   `medium-priority`, or `low-priority`

3. **Other issue types**: priority is optional but encouraged for clarity

4. **AI usage labels**: Add when PR is created to track AI generation %. One per PR.

5. **Size labels**: Add during Analysis phase. One per capability/enhancement.

6. **Risk labels**: Add during Analysis phase. One per capability.

7. **Status labels** (`ready`, `blocked`, `needs-analysis`, `needs-triage`): May be
   auto-managed by the system as issues progress through workflow columns.

8. **Technical area, workflow, and meta labels**: Apply as many as relevant. Not exclusive.

---

## Initiative and Objective Labels

These labels are not defined in `labels.json` but are used as a convention:

- `initiative:<name>` — maps to the "Initiative" single-select field on the project board
- `objective:<name>` — maps to the "Objective" single-select field on the project board

When applied to an issue, run `labels sync-fields` to propagate the value to the board field.

The mount-olympus board maintains the full set of initiative and objective options. When
creating a new initiative or objective, add the field option using `fields create-option`.

Example label names:
- `initiative:olympus-v1`
- `initiative:platform-stability`
- `objective:platform-launch`
- `objective:q1-2026-mvp`

---

## Label Deployment Notes

When deploying labels to a new repository:

```bash
python3 sdlc_manager.py labels deploy --repo <repo-name>
```

- Creates labels that don't exist
- Updates color and description on labels that exist with different values
- Does NOT delete labels that exist in the repo but aren't in `labels.json`
- Safe to re-run as many times as needed

When auditing a repository:

```bash
python3 sdlc_manager.py labels audit --repo <repo-name>
```

Output categories:
- **Present**: Labels from `labels.json` that exist in the repo
- **Missing**: Labels from `labels.json` that do NOT exist in the repo
- **Extra**: Labels in the repo that are not in `labels.json` (informational only)
