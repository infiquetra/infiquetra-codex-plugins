    ``sandbox`` (a Unit's declared containment) + ``write_set`` (its declared files) thread through
    to the envelope builders (#287 U5): a sandboxed-mutate agy unit lifts to patch-only. Native
    Codex agents are never external-engine routes and fail before a provider call.

    ``ledger``/``subplot_id``/``at`` (#401) are **telemetry only** — when all are supplied a real
    advisory call records an ``engine`` run-fact (and a ``delegation`` fact for an ``agy.delegation.v1``
    call). This never gates and never changes the returned evidence (KTD5); omitting them is a no-op, so
    every existing caller is byte-identical.

    Two-signal acceptance (#384 U5, R4/R6, KTD6/KTD7) is opt-in through three new kwargs:

    - ``session_id`` — when supplied, the dispatch layer ARMS the delegation-liveness marker
      (``delegation_state.arm``) before running the adapter and disarms it in a ``finally``.
      An arming failure never blocks dispatch: it is recorded fail-open as a named
      ``tripwire_unarmed`` note on the evidence provenance (and the manifest).
    - ``workspace_root`` — the repo root under which the engine's bundle artifacts live;
      supplying it (or ``gated=True``) enables observer corroboration after the run:
      observer-yes = bundle ``launch_key`` true (``delegation_audit.corroborate``) AND a
      ``_receipt_problems()``-clean receipt. A missing launch flag is observer-NO
      (conservative).
    - ``gated`` — a self-report "ok" with observer-no becomes ``DELEGATION_INTEGRITY``:
      dispatch returns a typed :class:`RequeueDisposition` ONCE, and a second consecutive
      divergence for the same session+engine raises :class:`DispatchError` (HALT, KTD7).
      Advisory (``gated=False``) divergence keeps the existing ``downgrade_note`` mechanism
      with the integrity reason attached — no re-queue loop.

    Omitting all three keeps every existing caller byte-identical.

    ``expected_identity`` (#390 U2, KTD3) is the plan-time preview baseline in ``engine/variant``
    form. When supplied it is stamped verbatim onto the evidence provenance so
    :func:`build_dispatch_manifest` can derive ``Disposition.SUBSTITUTED_ENGINE`` when the engine
    that actually resolved/ran differs from the one the plan previewed. ``None`` (the default)
    stamps nothing and keeps every existing path byte-for-byte -- the resolver/registry seam
    (#388) is never touched.

    ``chaperone`` (#381) is advisory chaperone-economics provenance. When supplied, it is copied
    under ``provenance["chaperone"]`` for downstream review/work-session evidence. It does not
    change gate satisfaction or ``saga.manifest.v1``.

    Issue #393 adds a first prerequisite: every source finding must appear in a typed
    reconciliation result. This check deliberately runs before the existing authority checks; it
    only closes an evidence-completeness gap and does not replace or relax any prior refusal.

    R11 extension (U3): when a typed manifest accompanies the evidence, a gated verdict
    additionally requires every gate-relevant claim to be Codex-adjudicated — a
    claimed-only manifest (any claim with no adjudicated status or no attested
    adjudication record) is refused. The manifest itself stays advisory evidence (R8/R20);
    only this existing gate consumes it.

    `manifest` is opt-in by signature, not by safety: this function cannot detect that a
    manifest with unresolved claim_provenance exists and simply wasn't threaded through.
    Any caller that has a manifest for this evidence MUST pass it here for the R11
    per-claim check to run at all -- silently omitting it degrades the guarantee to the
    evidence-level `verified_by_claude` bit alone.

    Two-signal acceptance (#384 U5/R6): beside ``verified_by_claude``, a gated verdict
    additionally requires OBSERVER corroboration — the ``observer_corroborated`` provenance
    mark :func:`dispatch` stamps only when the bundle launch flag was true AND the receipt
    was ``_receipt_problems()``-clean. Codex's own say-so is one signal; the gate needs
    both. Divergent or uncorroborated "ok" evidence can therefore never satisfy a gate.

    Substitution refusal (#390 U2/KTD5): a manifest whose disposition is
    ``SUBSTITUTED_ENGINE`` is refused outright -- a run that executed a different engine than the
    plan approved can never satisfy a gate as-approved, regardless of how well-corroborated its
    (wrong-engine) evidence is.

    Bridge liveness (#388 U5): when the gate caller has both the run ledger and manifest store,
    the producer/consumer bridge-run join must be contradiction-free. A launched run that was never
    consumed, or a consumed manifest whose run was never launched, blocks the gate.

    Advisory-reviewer refusal (#382): reviewer-role external evidence is report-only. Even when
    Codex verifies the evidence and the observer corroborates the run, it cannot satisfy a gate or
    move Verified Workflows consensus threshold math.
