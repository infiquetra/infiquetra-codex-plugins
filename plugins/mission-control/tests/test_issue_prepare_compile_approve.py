"""Tests for the U11 prepared-issue compile + approve flow.

Covers the four U11 pieces layered on the existing prepare/sidecar machinery:
  1. project-field population in the sidecar (offline, derived from metadata),
  2. the durable `needs_operator_approval` human gate,
  3. batch approval out of that gate, and
  4. the Phase C validator (`validate_card_body`) as the compile-time acceptance
     gate on agent output (KTD9).

Mirrors the fixtures/conventions in test_issue_prepare.py: tmp_path-scoped,
fully offline (no live GitHub call), sidecar read back as JSON.
