description: The Infiquetra lifecycle META-IMPROVEMENT ENGINE. The TERMINAL, ADVISORY lifecycle phase downstream of /qa — it reads the work that shipped, gathers evidence (git forensics behind a stale-base/wrong-today BLOCK guard, saga trajectory, gh issues/PRs READ-ONLY, session transcripts), interviews the operator, writes a concise agent-consumable retro doc, PROMOTES generalizable findings into the engineering journal (pure-append, auto), CURATES the journal + auto-memory (staleness / contradiction / dedup / rule-enforcement sweeps, propose-diff-and-wait), and runs net-new meta-improvement passes (new-skill detection, refine the lifecycle SKILLs, refine directives, prune memory) — every one gated. It never blocks /loop, never mutates the world, never writes the saga, and never self-applies a non-journal edit. Triggers on "retro", "retrospective", "what did we learn", "leave the system smarter", a /qa or /handoff hand-in, or the end of a meaningful work loop / PR / deploy.

# Retro

`/retro` answers **"What did this work teach us — and how does the system get smarter because of it?"**
It is the lifecycle's **meta-improvement engine**: the terminal phase that turns a finished thread (or a
time window of work) into durable knowledge, curated journal state, and concrete, gated proposals to
improve the lifecycle itself.

This engine is a faithful 3-source merge: the **git forensics + the stale-base/wrong-today BLOCK guard**
come from **gstack `retro`**; the **curation engine (staleness / contradiction sweeps, propose-via-question)**
comes from **gstack `learn`**; and the **compounding frame — "the first time you solve a problem takes
research, the next time is a lookup; knowledge compounds"** comes from **CE `ce-compound`** (plus its
parallel-subagent research pattern for the transcript fan-out).

## Position in the lifecycle

`/retro` is the saga `LIFECYCLE_PHASES` **`retro`** slot — the **terminal** phase, with **`resume-ready`**
maturity (`scripts/saga.py:56`, `:72`):

- `/qa` answers: "Does the shipped thing actually work?" (the acceptance gate)
- **`/retro` answers: "What did we learn, and how does the system get smarter?"** (this engine — terminal)

`/retro` is **ADVISORY**: `/loop` names it as the next command after `/qa` but **never blocks the router**
on its output (`loop/references/dispatch-table.md`). It is **READ-ONLY on the world** — it reads issues,
PRs, checks, and the board via `gh` and never mutates them (**mission-control owns the SDLC**); it reads git
and the saga and writes **no** saga tick (the `->retro` advance is dead wiring — `/retro` is saga
READ-ONLY). Surfaced follow-ups become a `/handoff` (new issue) or a `QUEUED.md` entry — `/retro` routes
them, it does not file them.

## Core principles

1. **Leave the system smarter (compounding).** Every retro must make the next unit of work easier, not
   harder. A retro **diffs against the last retro** so knowledge accumulates instead of repeating: "first
   time research, next time lookup." A retro that records nothing durable was a wasted retro.
2. **Evidence before narrative, with the stale-base/wrong-today guard.** Never assert system state you have
   not just verified from a current source. For the time-windowed mode, the **stale-base/wrong-today BLOCK
   guard runs first** (Phase 1): if the window would be computed against a stale base or a wrong "today",
   **BLOCK and ask** rather than fabricate a coherent-looking narrative from near-zero commits. Validation
   discipline is load-bearing here — the engine's whole value is that it tells the truth about what
   shipped.
3. **The journal is the durable sink.** The markdown engineering journal — `LEARNINGS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
   `QUEUED.md`, `ARCHIVE.md` — is canonical for durable knowledge; `docs/retros/` holds the per-thread
   writeup that links to it. Findings flow **into** the journal, not into a separate store.
4. **Curate, do not just append.** Promotion is additive, but a journal that only grows rots. `/retro`
   runs curation sweeps over the journal and the auto-memory — **staleness** (entries citing deleted
   files / PRs / SHAs), **contradiction** (conflicting entries on the same key), **dedup** (an infiquetra
   addition to the sweep set), and **journal-rule enforcement** (e.g. the `MEMORY.md` ~24.4KB size rule).
5. **Self-modification is gated.** This is the load-bearing contract — see
   **THE TIERED SELF-EDIT SAFETY CONTRACT** below and `references/self-edit-safety.md`. The one-line rule:
   **AUTO-APPLY is ONLY a pure additive append of a NEW journal entry; everything else is
   propose-diff-and-wait.**
6. **Read-only on the world.** `gh` and `git` are used **read-only**; `/retro` never opens, edits, or
   merges an issue or PR, never deploys, and never writes the saga. Follow-ups are **routed**, not run.
   Big multi-file refactors surfaced by a pass are **offered** with a backend (operator-choice), never
   auto-run.
7. **Agent-consumable output.** The deliverable is **structured findings + concrete edit proposals**, not
   a 4500-word essay. A future agent should be able to read the retro doc and the journal entries cold and
   act on them.

## Interaction method

Use `Codex blocking question` for choices from a known set (scope when several threads match, which curation
proposals to apply, the FAIL routing target, an execution backend for a big refactor). Call `ToolSearch`
with `blocking question` first if its schema is not loaded. Free-form questions stay inline. Ask one
question per turn; never silently skip a question.

In a channel session (`redis-channel` active), `Codex blocking question` **cannot** be called — inline the choices
in your reply text instead, following the canonical channel-inline convention in
`saga/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (do not duplicate its wording here).

Use **repo-relative paths** in every generated document and proposal. The one deliberate exception is a
GLOBAL/CROSS-PROJECT directive target under `~/.codex/` — an absolute path **on purpose**, because the
file genuinely lives outside this repo (see the contract below).

---

## THE TIERED SELF-EDIT SAFETY CONTRACT

This is the load-bearing safety rule of the engine. Read `references/self-edit-safety.md` for the full
presentation format; the gate itself is:

> **AUTO-APPLY is ONLY a PURE ADDITIVE APPEND of a NEW journal entry (LEARNINGS / DECISIONS / QUEUED /
> ARCHIVE). ANY delete, modify, or move of existing lines is PROPOSE-DIFF-AND-WAIT.**

- **AUTO (no confirmation):** appending one **new** entry to `LEARNINGS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `QUEUED.md`,
  or `ARCHIVE.md`. Nothing existing changes — the file only grows by a self-contained block.
- **PROPOSE-DIFF-AND-WAIT (show the diff + `Codex blocking question` apply / skip / modify; NEVER auto-apply):**
  - any **edit** to an existing journal entry (the curation sweeps);
  - a **QUEUED → ARCHIVE move** — it *deletes* lines from `QUEUED.md`, so it is **propose, not auto**,
    even though the ARCHIVE side is an append;
  - the **`.codex` auto-memory** — `MEMORY.md` and its topic files;
  - **directive files** (the repo `AGENTS.md`, the global `~/.codex` directives);
  - the **saga SKILLs themselves — INCLUDING `skills/retro/SKILL.md`**: `/retro` may
    *propose* a diff to its own skill, but it **never self-applies** one.

**Directive surfaces are NOT one bucket.** Disambiguate before proposing:

- **(a) IN-REPO** — the repo `AGENTS.md` and the lifecycle SKILLs. (This plugin has **no `agents/` dir**;
  the convention is **generic agents**, so there is no in-repo agent file to edit.) A normal
  propose-diff-and-wait, repo-relative path.
- **(b) GLOBAL / CROSS-PROJECT** — `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.codex/agents/*.md`, and antigravity
  directives. These live **OUTSIDE this repo and affect EVERY project.** A global/cross-project proposal
  carries an **EXPLICIT warning in the diff header**:
  > **WARNING: this changes your GLOBAL Codex config and affects ALL projects, not just this repo.**

**Never auto-launch** a destructive self-edit or an execution backend. A workflow mode
(`verified-workflow`) for a big refactor is **offered** per `../../references/operator-choice.md`, never
started without the operator's pick.

---

## Phase 0 — Enter, scope, restore

Establish what this retro covers before gathering any evidence.

**Parse the input.** Take the target from command arguments or the active artifact:

- a **saga id / issue (`#N`) / branch** → a **thread-scoped** retro (one work thread);
- a **time window** ("last week", "since 2026-05-20") → a **meta-retro** over a span of work;
- bare "retro" with an in-flight thread → thread-scoped on that thread; otherwise ask once: "What should
  I retro — a thread (issue / branch / saga), or a time window?"

**Restore (read-only, never mint).** For a thread-scoped retro, anchor on the saga:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py restore --saga-id <issue-N|task-slug>
```

`restore` is cold and branch-agnostic (saga-spec §7.2). If no saga is found, `/retro` still runs from
`gh` + git + docs. **Never mint a saga** from `/retro` — it is saga READ-ONLY (`saga.py save` is never
called).

**Announce scope.** State the mode (thread-scoped vs meta-retro), the thread / window, and what evidence
will be gathered. The **stale-base guard is a WINDOW freshness check** that runs in Phase 1 for the
time-windowed mode only; a **thread-scoped retro computes no git window**, so instead it verifies the
saga / PR evidence is **at the current HEAD** (a stale-thread analogue of the same discipline).

---

## Phase 1 — Gather evidence (READ-ONLY)

All evidence is read-only. See `references/retro-passes.md` for the exact queries.

**1.1 Time-windowed mode — run the stale-base/wrong-today BLOCK guard FIRST.** Before any window query:
fetch `origin/<default>`, read the latest commit date, and compare it against the window. Compute **today
from the session reminder's `## currentDate`, NEVER from the `date` command** (a containerized clock can
be hours off). If the latest commit predates `(today − window)`, **BLOCK** with an explanation and an
`Codex blocking question` (confirm today / re-fetch / proceed-anyway), because the window would otherwise
fabricate a narrative from near-zero commits. The graceful, **disclosed** skip paths — no remote, detached
HEAD, offline fetch failure — proceed with the reason carried into the retro narrative
(`references/retro-passes.md`). Thread-scoped retros skip this block and run the HEAD-freshness check
instead.

**1.2 Lean git metrics + diff-vs-last.** Run the **lean** subset of gstack's forensics, **solo-framed**
(the gstack team-performance framing — leaderboard, praise, streaks, tweetable, global, week-over-week —
is **shed**). Report them **in prose** (commits in scope, files / hotspots touched, test-vs-prod balance,
PRs referenced), then **diff vs the last retro** so the retro compounds.

**1.3 Saga trajectory.** Read the whole tick chain, not just the last frame:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py ticks --saga-id <issue-N|task-slug>
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/load_saga_context.py --repo <owner/repo> --issue <N>
```

`ticks` (`saga.py:755`, CLI `:1099`) surfaces how the phase advanced, when blockers cleared, which
questions got answered — the trajectory of the work.

**1.4 PR / issue / check evidence (gh READ-ONLY).** Read the PRs, issues, review decisions, and CI checks
for the thread or window via `gh` — read commands only (`gh pr view`, `gh issue view`, `gh pr checks`).
Never `gh issue create`, never `gh pr merge`.

**1.5 Session-transcript skeletons.** Reuse the `/resume` forensic substrate — **file-mediated,
context-safe**. Identify sessions from the saga / branch for a thread-scoped retro, or via
`discover_sessions.py` for the windowed mode; extract each with `extract_session_skeleton.py` to a scratch
dir; an **optional generic-sub-agent fan-out (one per session)** synthesizes them — offered per
operator-choice, **never** via an `agents/` dir (this plugin has none; use generic `Explore` / `Task`).
The orchestrator never reads a raw `.jsonl` or a skeleton file — paths only.

**1.6 Provenance-manifest signals (read-only, advisory).** When the window covers delegated
executions that recorded provenance manifests, run the manifest reader beside the other
read-only telemetry to surface three signals — **parroting count** (claims a producer claimed
`verified` that adjudication refuted or found unsupported), **disposition rate** (fraction
landing `ran-as-requested` / `fell-back-to-claude` / `substituted-engine`), and the
**adjudicated verified ratio** (`verified / (verified + inferred + not-checked)`):

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/manifest_reader.py --root <saga-manifests-dir> [--json]
```

The R7 parroting taxonomy is defined once in `provenance_manifest.py`, never redefined here.
**Zero-data contract**: an empty or absent manifest tree is **"no data yet"** — carry it
verbatim, never fabricate a rate. This pass is read-only and advisory-only: a low verified
ratio or a nonzero parroting count is signal for the interview, never a gate.

**1.7 Reconciliation recipe proposals (read-only).** Resolve the repository's
`run_ledger.RunLedger`, then call `reconcile.derive_recipe_update_proposal(ledger)`. The reader
verifies the hash chain, validates every typed reconciliation fact, and deduplicates reconcile/apply
events by stable `reconciliation_id`. Treat a chain break, non-trailing corruption, or invalid fact
as a visible evidence failure; only the ledger's existing torn trailing-line tolerance is allowed.

The `recipe_update_proposal.v1` result is derive-on-read and always advisory. A proposal requires
operator approval and never edits `RECIPE_REGISTRY`, appends to the ledger, or authorizes a route.
Carry it into the interview and retro doc as **PROPOSE-DIFF-AND-WAIT** input; implementation belongs
in a separate authorized work path.

---

## Phase 2 — Structured interview

Interview the operator, **grounded in the Phase-1 evidence** (not generic prompts). Use **free-form for
substance** and `Codex blocking question` for routing / choices.

The substance questions (free-form): what shipped · what surprised · what slowed the work · what evidence
actually mattered · what should change. The full bank is in `references/retro-passes.md`. Anchor each
question in something Phase 1 found ("the saga shows round 3 re-opened on a test gate — what was the real
blocker?"), so the answers add signal the evidence cannot.

Channel-session fallback: inline the choices in reply text per the brainstorm convention (cited above) —
do not call `Codex blocking question`.

---

## Phase 3 — Write the retro doc

Write a **concise, agent-consumable** retro to:

```
docs/retros/<saga-id-or-issue>-<date>.md
```

Structure per `references/retro-report.md`: structured findings linked to the Phase-1 evidence + the
**diff-vs-last** delta, not an essay. This is a **NEW doc → auto-write** — it is a fresh file, not an edit
to existing content, so it is outside the propose-gate.

---

## Phase 4 — Journal promotion + curation

**PROMOTE (AUTO — pure append, per the contract).** Append **new** entries:

- generalizable findings → `LEARNINGS.md`;
- pattern / convention / tooling decisions → `DECISIONS.md`;
- deferred work → `QUEUED.md`;
- shipped / superseded items → `ARCHIVE.md`.

Each follows the existing journal entry format (the block-quote intros at the top of each file;
`references/retro-report.md` carries the templates). A pure append needs no confirmation.

**CURATE (PROPOSE-DIFF-AND-WAIT — the gstack-`learn` sweeps over the journal).** Run, and for each finding
show a diff + `Codex blocking question` (apply / skip / modify):

- **staleness** — entries citing deleted files / merged-and-gone PRs / rewritten SHAs (Glob / `gh` check);
- **contradiction** — conflicting entries on the same topic / key (gstack `learn`'s contradiction sweep);
- **dedup** — near-duplicate entries collapsed (the **infiquetra addition** to the sweep set — in gstack
  this was a Stats *display* op, here it is a real Prune sweep);
- **journal-rule enforcement** — e.g. `MEMORY.md` over the ~24.4KB size rule, or an over-long index entry
  that should move detail to a topic file.

A `QUEUED → ARCHIVE` move (an item that shipped this thread) **deletes from `QUEUED.md`**, so it is a
**propose**, not an auto-append.

---

## Phase 5 — Meta-improvement passes (net-new; ALL propose-diff-and-wait)

The passes neither source had, all gated (`references/retro-passes.md`):

- **(a) new-skill / plugin detection** — repeated friction that a new skill or plugin would remove →
  propose a `QUEUED.md` entry or a `/handoff`.
- **(b) refine-lifecycle** — propose diffs to the saga SKILLs when the thread exposed a
  gap or a wrong instruction (including `skills/retro/SKILL.md` — proposal only, never self-applied).
- **(c) refine-directives** — propose diffs to the **repo `AGENTS.md`** (in-repo) or the **global
  `~/.codex` directives** (global carries the cross-project warning, per the contract).
- **(d) memory pruning** — propose curation of the `.codex` auto-memory (`MEMORY.md` + topic files) per
  the journal-rule + staleness + contradiction sweeps.

A **big multi-file refactor** surfaced by any pass → **OFFER** a backend per
`../../references/operator-choice.md` (`inline`, `manual`, or `verified-workflow`). **Never auto-run** it.

---

## Phase 6 — Route

Surfaced follow-ups exit to:

- **`/handoff`** — a follow-up that should become an SDLC issue (envelope per `/loop`'s Phase 4.2);
- **`QUEUED.md`** — a follow-up that is durable backlog, not yet an issue.

Route per `loop/references/dispatch-table.md` — **read** it, never restate it. `/retro` is terminal: there
is **NO saga write** (the `->retro` advance is dead wiring; `/retro` is saga READ-ONLY).

---

## Hard boundary

`/retro` gathers evidence, interviews, writes the retro doc, appends journal entries, proposes curation +
meta-improvement edits, and routes — then stops. It does **NOT**:

- mutate the world — `gh` / `git` are **read-only**; it never opens / edits / merges an issue or PR, never
  files SDLC issues (mission-control owns the SDLC), never deploys;
- **auto-apply a non-journal edit** — every delete / modify / move (curation, auto-memory, directives,
  lifecycle SKILLs including its own) is propose-diff-and-wait;
- **auto-launch a backend or a destructive self-edit** — backends are offered, never started;
- **write the saga** — terminal phase, saga READ-ONLY, `saga.py save` is never called;
- **mutate the SDLC** — issues / boards / labels belong to mission-control;
- add an `agents/` dir — the transcript fan-out uses **generic** `Explore` / `Task` agents.

It never blocks the router.

## Reference files

- `references/retro-passes.md` — the multi-pass procedure: the stale-base guard pre-flight, the lean-metrics
  git queries (team-perf shed, solo-framed) + diff-vs-last, the gstack-`learn` curation sweeps
  (staleness / contradiction / dedup / rule-enforcement), the transcript-review fan-out (reusing the
  `/resume` scripts + operator-choice + generic agents), the interview question bank, and the three
  self-refinement passes + memory pruning.
- `references/self-edit-safety.md` — the load-bearing tiered self-edit contract: the auto vs
  propose-diff-and-wait gate, the propose-diff presentation format, the in-repo vs global/cross-project
  directive disambiguation with the cross-project warning, and never-auto-launch.
- `references/retro-report.md` — the `docs/retros/` writeup shape (agent-consumable structured findings,
  links + diff-vs-last) and the journal-promotion entry templates (LEARNINGS / DECISIONS / QUEUED / ARCHIVE).
- `../../references/operator-choice.md` — the 3-backend contract for offering a refactor backend.
- `loop/references/dispatch-table.md` — the outbound routing reference (read, never restate).
- `../brainstorm/SKILL.md` — the canonical channel-inline convention (cite, never duplicate).
- `../../references/saga-spec.md` — the saga contract (`restore` / `ticks`; `/retro` is read-only).
