"""Tests for `board add` explicit multi-project membership (U12).

The U12 live smoke test confirmed native Projects-v2 multi-membership
(KTD10): one issue node id added to two boards via separate
`addProjectV2ItemById` mutations carries INDEPENDENT per-board Status — it
is not a clone. These tests pin the tooling that exposes that behavior:

  * `board add --project A --project B` adds the SAME content/item id to the
    two DISTINCT project ids via exactly two add-to-project mutations
    (independent memberships, not a clone).
  * back-compat: a single `--project` still targets exactly that one
    project; no `--project` still resolves via `get_projects_for_repo`
    (the repo → project mapping).

All GitHub/GraphQL calls are patched at the sdlc_manager-module level — no
real network. `_graphql` is the single mutation funnel for both the
node-id lookup and each add-to-project call, so asserting on its call list
fully characterizes the membership behavior offline.
