# Issue Types Reference

Complete guide to all five Infiquetra SDLC issue types. This replaces the traditional
Epic/Feature/Story/Task hierarchy with types optimized for AI-assisted development.

An Objective is not an issue type. It is an `Objective` project-field option
plus an Outcome Scorecard doc. Capabilities carry the field value and are
top-level by default.

## Decision Tree

```
Is it broken functionality?
+- Yes -> DEFECT
+- No
   +- Is it new functionality?
      +- Yes
      |  +- Is it end-to-end and deployable independently?
      |     +- Yes -> CAPABILITY
      |     +- No -> ENHANCEMENT (or break down if too large)
      +- No
         +- Are you improving existing functionality?
            +- Yes -> ENHANCEMENT
            +- No
               +- Are you researching or investigating?
                  +- Yes -> EXPLORATION
                  +- No
                     +- Are you updating documentation?
                        +- Yes -> CONTEXT UPDATE
                        +- No -> Reconsider what you're trying to accomplish
```

## Objective Representation

Use an Objective when several Capabilities contribute to one time-bounded
delivery target. Create or select the board's `Objective` field option, maintain
the Outcome Scorecard in the owning context library, and assign that field value
to every Capability and child card. Do not create an Objective issue or apply an
`objective` type label.

Native parent links are independent of Objective grouping. A Capability has no
parent by default. Add a parent only when it is a real decomposition child, or
when a long-lived initiative board explicitly uses Outcome proof cards.

---

## 1. Capability

**Definition**: A complete, deployable piece of system functionality that delivers meaningful business
or technical value. The primary unit of work in AI-native development.

### When to Use
- Delivers complete end-to-end functionality (UI + API + data + infrastructure)
- Can be deployed and used independently
- Has clear acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Represents meaningful business value
- Requires 1-4 weeks with AI assistance

### When NOT to Use
- The work improves existing functionality -> use **Enhancement**
- Something is broken in production -> use **Defect**
- You need to research options first -> use **Exploration**
- Scope exceeds 4 weeks -> break into multiple Capabilities

### Size / Duration
1-4 weeks with AI assistance:

| Size | Duration | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| XS | 1-2 days | Add new API endpoint with basic CRUD |
| S | 3-5 days | Auth integration with external provider |
| M | 1-2 weeks | Notification system with message queue + workers |
| L | 2-4 weeks | Identity verification service with multiple providers |

### Template Labels
- Current template labels: `capability`, `hermes-task`, `needs-plan`
- Do not use `needs-analysis` as the current template default; it may still appear from legacy
  auto-label fallback rules.
- See `templates-reference.md` for the generated label and field contract.

### Examples
**Good**:
- "Implement user onboarding service with API, database persistence, and monitoring"
- "Add biometric authentication flow to app with backend API integration"
- "Create automated notification system with retry logic"

**Not a Capability (too small)**:
- "Add logging to API endpoint" -> use **Enhancement**
- "Fix timeout error in auth API" -> use **Defect**

**Not a Capability (too large)**:
- "Implement entire identity verification platform" -> break into multiple Capabilities

---

## 2. Enhancement

**Definition**: Improves an existing capability without adding fundamentally new functionality.
For optimization, refinement, refactoring, and incremental improvements.

### When to Use
- Improves existing functionality
- Optimizes performance or reduces cost
- Enhances user experience
- Adds minor features to an existing capability
- Refactors existing code

### When NOT to Use
- Building new end-to-end functionality -> use **Capability**
- Fixing broken functionality in production -> use **Defect**

### Size / Duration
2-5 days with AI assistance:

| Duration | Complexity | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 2 hours | Trivial | Add log statement, update copy text |
| 1 day | Simple | Add validation, simple refactor |
| 2-3 days | Moderate | Add caching, improve error handling |
| 4-5 days | Complex | Significant refactor, performance optimization |

### Template Labels
- Current template labels: `enhancement`, `hermes-task`, `needs-plan`
- Do not use `needs-analysis` as the current template default; it may still appear from legacy
  auto-label fallback rules.
- See `templates-reference.md` for the generated label and field contract.

### Examples
**Good**:
- "Add caching layer to reduce API latency from 800ms to 200ms"
- "Improve error messages in authentication flow"
- "Add pagination to user list endpoint"
- "Refactor auth service for better testability"

**Not an Enhancement**:
- "Build authentication service" -> use **Capability** (new functionality)
- "Fix crash in auth validation" -> use **Defect** (broken functionality)

---

## 3. Defect

**Definition**: A bug or issue in production that requires fixing. Defects have the highest priority
and shortest cycle time targets.

### When to Use
- Functionality that previously worked is now broken
- Functionality doesn't match the specification
- Error or exception occurs in production
- Performance has regressed significantly
- Security vulnerability discovered

### When NOT to Use
- Adding new functionality -> use **Capability** or **Enhancement**
- Pre-production issues discovered during development -> fix inline or use **Enhancement**

### Size / Duration
Hours to 2 days. Priority determines SLA:

| Priority | SLA | Description | Examples |
|----------|-----|-------------|---------|
| Critical | 4 hours | System down, data loss, security breach | API returning 500, data corruption |
| High | 1 day | Major functionality broken | Auth failing, can't create records |
| Medium | 3 days | Minor functionality broken | Validation too strict, UI glitch |
| Low | When capacity | Cosmetic or rare edge case | Typo, rare race condition |

### Template Labels
- Current template labels: `defect`, `hermes-task`, `needs-plan`
- Add exactly one priority label manually when the defect severity is known:
  `critical`, `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, or `low-priority`.
- Do not use `needs-triage` as the current template default; it may still appear from legacy
  auto-label fallback rules.
- See `templates-reference.md` for the generated label and field contract.

### Examples
**Good**:
- "API returning 500 error for valid requests since deploy at 14:30"
- "Auth token validation failing for tokens issued before Jan 15"
- "Record creation silently failing for IDs with special characters"

**Not a Defect**:
- "Auth service could be faster" -> use **Enhancement** (performance improvement, not regression)
- "Add retry logic to external API calls" -> use **Enhancement** (new resilience feature)

---

## 4. Exploration

**Definition**: Research, proof-of-concept, or architectural investigation that informs future
decisions. Produces knowledge, not production code.

### When to Use
- Need to evaluate multiple technical approaches
- Uncertain about feasibility
- Need to learn a new technology or library
- Architectural decision requires validation
- Estimating a large Capability requires research first

### When NOT to Use
- You already know the approach -> create a **Capability** directly
- Exploration exceeds 3 days -> timebox strictly; create follow-up Exploration if needed

### Size / Duration
1-3 days maximum (timebox strictly).

### Template Labels
- Current template labels: `exploration`, `research`, `hermes-not-actionable`
- Exploration cards are context for research and decisions, not Hermes task cards.
- See `templates-reference.md` for the generated label and field contract.

### Exploration Outcomes
- **Clear Recommendation**: Document in Blueprint, create ADR, create follow-up Capability
- **Need More Research**: Document learnings, create refined follow-up Exploration
- **Not Feasible**: Document why, propose alternatives, inform stakeholders

### Examples
**Good**:
- "Evaluate auth SDK options: Auth0 vs. Clerk vs. Supabase Auth"
- "POC: Can we achieve <100ms latency with current architecture?"
- "Spike: Estimate effort to migrate database schema"
- "Investigation: Root cause of intermittent timeout errors in API service"

**Not an Exploration**:
- "Implement biometric authentication" -> use **Capability** (you already know the approach)

---

## 5. Context Update

**Definition**: Maintains the Blueprint Repository's accuracy and completeness. Essential for
agent effectiveness because Codex relies on up-to-date context in the blueprint repo.

### When to Use
- Implementing a Capability reveals spec gaps
- Architecture decision needs documenting (ADR)
- API contract changes
- New patterns or best practices emerge
- Existing docs become outdated
- Successful AI prompts should be saved for reuse

### When NOT to Use
- Changes to production code -> those are Capabilities or Enhancements

### Size / Duration
Hours to 1 day. Should accompany every Capability.

### Template Labels
- Current template labels: `context-update`, `documentation`, `hermes-not-actionable`
- Context Update cards are documentation/context work items, not Hermes task cards.
- See `templates-reference.md` for the generated label and field contract.

### Where to Document
| Content Type | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| Business Requirements | `infiquetra-blueprint/requirements/` |
| Technical Specifications | `infiquetra-blueprint/specifications/` |
| Architecture Decisions | `infiquetra-blueprint/architecture/decisions/` |
| Reusable Patterns | `infiquetra-blueprint/patterns/` |
| API Contracts | `infiquetra-blueprint/specifications/api/` |
| AI Prompts | `infiquetra-blueprint/ai-prompts/` |

### Examples
**Good**:
- "Update service specification with new webhook schema"
- "Add ADR-042 for choosing Auth0 over Clerk"
- "Document error handling patterns for API services"
- "Add successful Claude prompt for API generation to library"

**Not a Context Update**:
- "Refactor the API" -> use **Enhancement** (code change, not documentation)

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I combine issue types in one PR?**
- Capability + Context Update (document as you build)
- Enhancement + Defect (fix while improving)
- Avoid Capability + Enhancement (scope creep)

**Q: Should I create separate issues for frontend and backend?**
Generally no. A Capability should be end-to-end. Exception: if they can truly deploy independently.

**Q: How do I handle tech debt?**
- Refactoring code -> **Enhancement**
- Documenting known limitations -> **Context Update**
- Researching migration options -> **Exploration**

**Q: What if I don't know the size up front?**
Start with an **Exploration** to research and estimate, then create the **Capability**.

**Q: Can a Capability span multiple repositories?**
Yes, if it's one deployable feature. Track all changes in one Capability issue with links
to multiple PRs.
