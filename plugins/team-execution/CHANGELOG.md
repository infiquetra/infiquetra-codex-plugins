# Changelog - team-execution

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Add `artifact_pointer.py` and the artifact-pointer protocol (round-trip a pointer to an
  external artifact; a pointer to a missing target is a typed failure, not a silent no-op).
- Add resident-worker required-evidence-absence handling: `missing-output` and
  `skipped-by-config` are distinguished, non-applicable evidence is excluded from consensus
  rather than counted as a fabricated N/A vote (consensus dimension-exclusion hardening).
- Add `test_agent_tier_sync.py`: three-way drift guard across the agent TOML roster, the
  fleet-core tier palette, and `scripts/validate_codex_plugins.py`'s derived model hints.

### Changed
- Adopt fleet-core tier/effort resolution for the managed agent roster, replacing the
  previously hard-coded `TEAM_EXECUTION_MODEL_HINTS` table with a palette-derived projection.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Added the full managed Codex TOML agent roster under `agents/*.toml`.
- Added `scripts/sync_codex_agents.py` to dry-run and apply roster sync into
  `~/.codex/agents` without overwriting unmanaged local agents.

### Changed

- Active Codex docs now describe named-agent delegated dispatch with serial
  fallback instead of retired display-pane setup.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Validators are now a first-class umbrella alongside workers and reviewers.
- Added scanner, tester, monitor, and operational validator roster:
  `deploy-watcher`, `security-scanner`, `iac-cost-scanner`, `api-compat-scanner`,
  `dependency-scanner`, `smoke-tester`, `scenario-tester`, `api-contract-tester`,
  `sdk-regression-tester`, `event-flow-tester`, `ui-regression-tester`,
  `performance-tester`, `concurrency-tester`, `github-actions-monitor`, and
  `runtime-monitor`.
- Added validator reference docs for registry, criteria, execution order, evidence/state
  format, spawn quirks, and pane behavior.
- Added optional `.team-execution.json` guidance for `required_validators`,
  `disabled_validators`, `nonprod_workflows`, `scenario_hints`, and `smoke_targets`.
- Added guarded nonprod automation rules for Infiquetra repositories.
- Added `appsec-audit` skill for URL/input trust-boundary review, SSRF-style risk,
  redirects, metadata endpoints, allowlists, and evidence-backed findings.
- Added packaged `/team-setup` tmux assets:
  `docs/example_tmux.conf` and `docs/agent-overflow.sh`.

### Changed
- Phase A now derives a team plan from repo type, changed files, workflows, contracts,
  docs, tests, and optional `.team-execution.json`.
- Phase B order is now workers, reviewer consensus, scanners, PR/CI/nonprod coordination,
  testers, monitors, then completion.
- Reviewer non-consensus blocks validators unless the user explicitly overrides.
- Hard-fail scanner/tester findings block auto-merge, nonprod deploy, and completion.
- Remediation is capped at 3 loops before escalation.
- Plugin and marketplace metadata bumped to `2.0.0`.

### Removed
- Removed stale migration notes from the initial release entry.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Workers pack into 2x2 grids, while reviewers get solo windows.
- Shift+Down and Shift+Up require the tmux prefix, preserving terminal-app behavior.
- Window creation bells are silenced.
- Windows are named after agents.
- Window management with many agents adds prefix+w and prefix+f helpers.

### Changed
- Overflow routing uses a stable tmux window ID and delayed pane-title routing.
- tmux configuration documents the window layout model.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Workers no longer prompt the user for permissions; review cycles enforce quality.
- Agent overflow treats the main window differently from agent overflow windows.

### Changed
- Worker rows use `bypassPermissions` mode.
- Step B1 is the worker kickoff step.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Skill auto-suggests during plan mode for non-trivial plans.
- Natural-language triggers include agent-team phrasing.
- The user can decline team planning for the current session.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Environment pre-flight checks for the handoff rule, tmux environment, and settings.
- `/team-setup` wizard for setup validation and guided fixes.
- Dismissible tmux checks.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-25

- Initial release of the `team-execution` plugin.
- Two-phase execution model: Phase A during planning, Phase B direct orchestration.
- `team-execution` skill.
- `/team-execute` slash command.
- 3 base reviewers always present:
  - `devils-advocate-reviewer`: assumptions, edge cases, failure modes.
  - `security-reviewer`: OWASP, secrets, auth/authZ, and PII coverage.
  - `architecture-reviewer`: design patterns, separation of concerns, and conventions.
- 7 optional reviewers triggered by context:
  - `infra-reviewer`: cloud infrastructure.
  - `api-reviewer`: API design, versioning, and deprecation.
  - `testing-reviewer`: test coverage and patterns.
  - `code-quality-reviewer`: DRY, complexity, naming, and patterns.
  - `privacy-reviewer`: privacy by design and PII handling.
  - `clarity-reviewer`: documentation clarity.
  - `ai-usefulness-reviewer`: AI-consumability of specs and issues.
- Reference files for reviewer registry, review criteria, and consensus protocol.
- Plan triage escape hatch for trivial config-only changes.
- Plan type classification for code, docs/specs, and mixed plans.
