# Cross-runtime Outcome contract (#604 -> #34) — discovery, canonical status, protected handoff

The runtime-neutral contract that lets a conforming runtime discover and attach to an existing
Outcome by **canonical repository identity plus Outcome ID**. This is the Codex-side port
(infiquetra-codex-plugins#34) of the contract merged in infiquetra-claude-plugins#604: the golden
fixtures at `tests/fixtures/outcome-cross-runtime/v1/` are the upstream producer vocabulary,
consumed byte-verbatim (KTD5 of the #34 plan) — this port must not re-describe or loosen them,
and any desired schema change returns to the Claude contract issue first.

Two Codex invariants sit on top of the shared contract:

* **A handoff is scoped authority, never launch evidence (KTD2).** `attach --advance` enters the
  native `advance` whose dispatch is proven only by the protected `outcome.dispatch.v2`
  `ack_kind=launched` acknowledgement backed by an owner-user-state launch receipt; a handoff
  acceptance, a `handed-off` record, or a synthetic v1 dispatcher id never counts as launched.
* **The repository-wide dispatcher lease seam stays dormant (KTD6).** This port scopes broker
  consumption to handoff acceptance and its single authorized advance; wiring
  `default_lease_authority()` into `make_dispatcher` belongs to the cross-runtime-acceptance
  leaf, not here.

## Authority model (the asymmetry)

Two canonical sources, everywhere: the **committed** Outcome spec blob (never the working-tree
file, never any cache) and **GitHub** completion evidence (merged PRs, closed issues).

| context | may read | may mutate |
|---|---|---|
| same clone (same git common dir) | committed spec + GitHub + shared coordination state | one subplot, only under a validated protected handoff + #356 broker successor + #351 settlement identity |
| different clone / host | committed spec + GitHub | **nothing** — reconstruction is read-only, `mutation_allowed: false`, always |

Runtime-local directories (`~/.codex`, the other runtime's equivalent home, caches, transcripts,
launch receipts) are never canonical Outcome status. Copied handoff JSON, copied caches, and legacy
`outcome-bundle/1` files carry **no** authority (#604).

## Repository identity

`github.com/<owner>/<repo>`, derived from `remote.origin.url` only. Accepted spellings:
`https://github.com/o/r[.git]`, `git@github.com:o/r[.git]`, `ssh://git@github.com/o/r[.git]`.
Only a terminal `.git` is stripped. A credentialed URL, a foreign host, a local-path remote, a
missing origin, or anything else HALTs before any store access (#604). Filesystem proximity,
matching IDs, and newest timestamps are never identity proof.

## The four public schemas

All four are **closed**: an unknown field, a duplicate JSON key, a `bool` where an `int`
belongs, an oversized document (256 KiB cap), or an unknown schema string is a HALT, never a
shrug. Serialization is deterministic (`sort_keys`, compact separators) so equal inputs are
byte-equal everywhere.

### `outcome.discovery.v1` — the compatibility envelope

Emitted by `outcome discover <id>` from the committed blob. Fields: `schema`, `protocol`
(`version`/`min_supported`/`max_supported`/`required_capabilities[]`), `repository.identity`,
`outcome` (`id`/`spec_path`/`schema_version`/`spec_revision`), `committed`
(`commit_oid`/`blob_oid`/`sha256`), `authority` (the frozen map: structure=committed-spec,
completion=github, same_clone_coordination=git-common-dir+fleet-broker+dispatch-settlement,
cross_clone_mutation=forbidden), `producer` (`runtime`/`saga_version`). `producer` is
compatibility metadata, not authority — a receiver derives repository and committed facts
independently and compares; it never trusts the envelope's self-description.

### `outcome.canonical-status.v1` — the portable read-only projection

Emitted by `outcome attach <id>`. Fields: `schema`, `repository_identity`, `outcome_id`,
`committed`, `completed[]`, `candidate_frontier[]`, `unknown[]`, `node_completion[]`
(`subplot_id`/`contract`/`canonical_state` ∈ complete|open|unknown/`evidence_digest`),
`mutation_allowed: false`. Conservative evidence rules: an unreadable GitHub state, an
untracked non-code leaf (cache-resident marker), or a child-outcome node is `unknown` and is
excluded from the candidate frontier — unknown can only reduce apparent completion and
candidacy, never fabricate either. Treating the candidate frontier as dispatchable is a HALT
violation on the consumer side: the projection cannot prove another clone has no live dispatch.

### `outcome.handoff-reference.v1` — the printable pointer

Emitted by `outcome handoff <id> <subplot> --operation advance-one|attend`. Fields: `schema`,
`handoff_id` (32-hex), `digest` (the sealed offer record's sha256), `protocol`, `operation`,
`subplot_id`. It is a POINTER, never a bearer token: acceptance reopens the authoritative
protected local record and revalidates every binding; copied JSON authorizes nothing.

### `outcome.compatibility-halt.v1` — the closed failure receipt

Every rejection path returns `schema`, `code`, `unsupported`, `supported`, `next_action`.
Receipts never embed a local path, credential, raw file body, prompt, or transcript. Version
skew, capability gaps, and schema violations are checked **before** even benign cache mutation
(#604), so a compatibility error is provably side-effect free.

## Protocol negotiation

The envelope advertises one protocol integer plus a supported min/max range and named required
capabilities (`committed-spec-structure`, `github-completion`, `git-common-dir-coordination`,
`fleet-broker-fencing`, `dispatch-settlement-identity`). Acceptance computes the intersection
before any local coordination; an empty intersection or a missing capability returns the halt
receipt. There is no best-effort field dropping and no post-mutation downgrade.

## The protected handoff lifecycle (same clone only)

Records live under `<git-common-dir>/saga-outcomes/<outcome-id>/handoffs/`, write-once and
sealed (sha256 over the canonical record bytes). Three records per handoff:

1. **Offer** (`outcome.handoff-offer.v1`) — written INSIDE the #356 broker's settlement-close
   protected write (#355 linearization: prepare → protected writer → canonical close receipt),
   so offering and relinquishing are one receipt-bearing transition. Binds: repository
   identity, outcome id, committed commit/blob/digest, spec revision, protocol version, source
   runtime, broker-derived issuer + lease + fencing token, exact operation (`advance-one` or
   `attend`), one subplot, #351 idempotency identity (a non-empty dispatch id is required for
   `advance-one`, so the settled-attempt check is always live; `attend` derives a resume pointer
   and may omit it), issued/expires epochs (TTL ≤ 300 s), nonce. Issuer identity comes from the
   live broker lease record, never a caller label.
2. **Accept-intent** (`outcome.handoff-accept-intent.v1`) — write-once; binds exactly one
   receiver and the idempotency key. A second receiver HALTs; the same receiver resumes any
   crash gap idempotently.
3. **Accept-commit** (`outcome.handoff-accept-commit.v1`) — binds the successor lease id and
   token after `acquire_successor` succeeds against the close-receipt CAS.

Acceptance validates, in order: seal, freshness (expiry; > 30 s future issuance is clock-skew),
repository identity, committed digest + revision, working-tree byte-match (#604), operation,
subplot, #351 settled state, broker head/token/close-receipt — every failure a distinct halt
code (`handoff-expired`, `handoff-clock-skew`, `handoff-wrong-repository`,
`handoff-wrong-revision`, `handoff-wrong-operation`, `handoff-wrong-subplot`,
`handoff-receiver-conflict`, `handoff-superseded`, `handoff-source-not-closed`,
`handoff-already-settled`, `handoff-seal-invalid`, `working-tree-divergent`). If the receiver
dies after the grant, the broker's existing TTL/dead-owner recovery must close its token before
a new handoff; elapsed time alone grants nothing.

`attach --advance` re-checks the committed revision and the ready frontier AFTER authority
acquisition and enters the existing `advance` behind a one-subplot gate — there is no `--loop`,
no frontier-wide handoff, and a moved frontier HALTs (`handoff-frontier-changed`) rather than
broadening. `attach --attend` derives the native resume command only after every binding
validates.

## Legacy `outcome-bundle/1` — retired

`export` is a deprecated alias of `discover` (stderr warning, identical envelope bytes; no
completion events, dispatch records, or cache paths). `import` refuses every bundle with the
exact migration commands and writes nothing — no spec save, no event replay, no ledger append.
There is no escape hatch that copies a cache between hosts.

## Recovery guidance

* A halt receipt's `next_action` is always non-mutating and safe to follow verbatim.
* `handoff-superseded` / `handoff-source-not-closed`: the broker authority moved — request a
  fresh handoff from the current holder; never retry with the stale reference.
* An expired offer leaves the resource head closed with a receipt; the issuing side re-acquires
  through `acquire_successor` with its own close receipt (normal broker succession).
* Cross-clone consumers that need mutation must move to the clone holding the coordination
  state (or wait for a future networked active-dispatch authority — out of scope here).
