# DEBUG REPORT + learning capture + defect routing

The deliverable shapes for Phase 4. The DEBUG REPORT and its `Status` enum are GRAFTED from gstack
`investigate`. The report is **agent-consumable EVIDENCE** — a future agent reads it cold and acts on it.

---

## The DEBUG REPORT template

Write to `docs/investigations/<slug>-<date>.md` (repo-relative; `<slug>` kebab-case from the symptom or
issue). The enum'd shape:

```markdown
# DEBUG REPORT — <short symptom>

- **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
- **Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Source:** <issue #N | test path | error | description>

## Symptom
What the user / test observed (the surface failure), with the exact error or assertion.

## Root cause
The full causal chain from trigger to symptom, **no gaps**, with `file:line` references at each step.
For any uncertain link, the prediction that was tested and its result.

## Fix
What was changed, with `file:line` — OR "diagnosis only" if Phase 3 was skipped (and why: user chose
diagnosis-only, or the proper fix is real implementation work routed to /work).

## Evidence
The observations that ground the root cause: instrumented boundary captures, log lines, runtime values,
the reproduction showing the fix works, full-suite result. Concrete, not "it looks fixed".

## Regression test
Path to the failing-then-passing test (or "recommended: <path + what it should assert>" when diagnosis
only). Whether existing tests should have caught this and why they did not.

## Related
Prior bugs in the same area, recurring patterns (3+ locations), architectural notes, the saga id / PR /
issue refs touched.
```

**Status enum:**

- **DONE** — root cause found, fix applied, regression test written, full suite passes, original bug
  fresh-reproduced and confirmed fixed.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — diagnosed and (maybe) fixed, but cannot fully verify here (intermittent bug,
  needs staging, environment-dependent). State the residual concern.
- **BLOCKED** — root cause unclear after investigation (hypothesis-exhaustion or 3-failed-fix gate hit),
  escalated. State what was ruled out and what is needed to proceed.

This NEW doc is a fresh file → write it directly (it is not an edit to existing content).

## Journal-LEARNINGS promotion template (non-obvious root cause — gated, selective)

Promote to `docs/engineering-journal/LEARNINGS.md` **only** when the lesson is generalizable (a wrong
assumption about a shared dependency / framework / convention, or a pattern found in 3+ locations). Skip
silently for a mechanical one-off (typo, missed null) — compounding those clutters the journal. Offer
neutrally when the lesson is one sentence. A promotion is a **pure append** (per the journal rules); it
does not edit existing entries.

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line lesson>

**Context:** <what was being debugged>
**Evidence:** <PR / commit / file:line — the DEBUG REPORT path>
**Mechanism:** <WHY it happened, not just what — the root-cause chain in one or two sentences>
**Fix (or queued):** <what landed, or what was routed to /work>
**Generalizable rule:** <the lesson stripped from the incident — the highest-value line>
**Refs:** docs/investigations/<slug>-<date>.md
```

## /handoff defect-routing note (trackable confirmed defect)

When the investigation confirms a **trackable defect** that needs implementation work, route it through
`/handoff` as a **defect-type SDLC issue** (`handoff_envelope.py --issue-type defect`; `defect` is a real
mission-control taxonomy type). Two rules:

1. **The report is EVIDENCE, not a handoff source.** Open the defect by **describing the bug** — symptom,
   root cause, the fix the bug needs — in the issue body, and **LINK** the DEBUG REPORT
   (`docs/investigations/<slug>-<date>.md`) as supporting evidence. Do **not** pass the investigation doc
   as `--source`.
2. **NEVER pass the report path to `handoff_envelope`'s classifier.** `handoff_envelope.py`'s
   `infer_maturity` keys on path substrings — `docs/plans/` → `plan-ready`, `docs/brainstorms/` →
   `requirements-ready`, `docs/work-sessions/` → `resume-ready`, etc. It does **not** recognize
   `docs/investigations/`, so passing the report as `--source` would fall through to `requirements-ready`
   and mis-classify the handoff (a `requirements-ready` defect would then get bounced by `/work` back to
   `/plan`). `handoff_envelope.py` still **requires** a source — so give it the durable artifact that
   actually drives the work (or have `/handoff` open the issue from the described defect), and link the
   report as evidence. Carry the defect via `--issue-type defect`, never via the report path.

**The fix reaches `/work` via the /handoff ISSUE, not via `/work` reading `docs/investigations/`.** `/work`
consumes a **plan path**, a **GitHub issue ref**, or a **resume request** (`work/SKILL.md` Phase 0.1) — it
does **not** consume an investigation doc path. So: `/investigate` → `/handoff` → SDLC issue (DEFECT) →
`/work` executes the issue. An **inline trivial fix already applied + self-verified** routes instead to
`/work` or `/code-review` to SHIP it via a PR (the fix is on a branch; `/investigate` never pushes). A
**design problem** routes to `/brainstorm`. Route per `loop/references/dispatch-table.md` — read it, never
restate it. No saga write.
