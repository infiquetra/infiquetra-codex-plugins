"""Durable per-sub-outcome worktree lifecycle + the worktree-removed terminal (U7).

A **sub-outcome** (a ``child_spec_ref`` node, ``Node.is_outcome``) runs autonomously and concurrently
with its siblings, so each gets **one durable, named, owner-tagged git worktree** — shared across all of
that child's leaves, **not one-per-leaf** (R15). Plain code leaves run in the ambient outcome worktree
(the branch the operator/coordinator is already in) and are not managed here; only the autonomous
sub-outcomes need an isolated worktree so two concurrent children cannot collide on the working tree.

Three invariants this module enforces structurally:

* **Bounded proliferation (R15).** A hard cap on concurrent live worktrees: an N-sub-outcome outcome can
  never exhaust a solo machine's disk/inodes — past the cap, provisioning **defers** (the sub-outcome
  waits for a slot) rather than spawning an (N+1)th worktree. Heavy dependency installs are **shared**
  across an outcome's sibling worktrees via one ``shared_install_ref`` recorded on every entry.
* **git is the liveness source of truth (the U6 lesson).** Whether a worktree still exists is read from
  the injected :class:`WorktreeOps` (``git worktree list`` / path existence), never inferred from our
  own registry — so a worktree removed **out-of-band** is detected. Only a *definite* absence reaps or
  terminates; a transient ``git`` failure degrades safe (treat as present, never falsely terminate, R34).
* **The worktree-removed negative terminal (R32, the one U6 deferred).** A sub-outcome whose worktree
  vanished out-of-band reaches a **defined** terminal state — ``rejected`` (sticky, cascades like a block
  via R22 ``blocked_subtree``) — so its dependents do not hang on a dead worktree, exactly as U6 models a
  closed-unmerged PR / deleted branch.

The registry (``<store>/worktrees.json``) records the owner tag + shared-install ref + branch/path that
``git worktree list`` cannot carry; it is written **read-modify-write under the coordinator lease** (the
caller, ``advance``, holds it — single-writer, R13), so the non-atomic read-modify-write is safe.

House pattern (mirrors ``outcome_merge`` / ``outcome_github``): pure functions over an injected
:class:`WorktreeOps` adapter so the whole lifecycle is unit-testable with no real ``git worktree``; the
real adapter wires ``git`` with an injectable runner; no I/O at import.
